  # We can easily get notifications for GH Actions but not for anything else.
  # This does not trigger for GH Actions but it will trigger for other checks,
  # effectively chaining a GH Action after completion of any other checks.
  # We can use the continuation GH Action to receive notifications about the original check.
  # Note: we are using check_suite as a means to get a single notification for all
  # non-GH Action checks per commit per GH App. We can use check_run if we need more
  # granularity.
