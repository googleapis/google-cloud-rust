Idiomatic Rust client libraries for
[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) services.

> **NOTE:** this project is under development, all APIs are subject to change
> without notice. Some documentation is aspirational.

## Getting Started

The [User Guide] includes basic tutorials to get started with the Google Cloud
client libraries for Rust.

## Supported Rust Versions

We require Rust >= 1.85, as we anticipate this will be at least six months old
by the time this project is stabilized (GA may be even later).

However, we have not defined a policy as to how often we will update this
minimum version. We do intend to publish our policy before declaring that the
project is generally available.

## Contributing

Contributions to this library are always welcome and highly encouraged.
