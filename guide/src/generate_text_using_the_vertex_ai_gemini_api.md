# Generate text using the Vertex AI Gemini API

In this guide, you send a text prompt request, and then a multimodal prompt and
image request to the Vertex AI Gemini API and view the responses.

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you must have a Google Cloud project with the Vertex AI
API enabled. You can use the [Vertex AI setup guide] to complete these steps.

## Add the Vertex AI client library as a dependency

The Vertex AI client library includes many features. Compiling all of them is
relatively slow. To speed up compilation, you can just enable the features you
need:

```toml
{{#include ../samples/Cargo.toml:aiplatform}}
```

## Send a prompt to the Vertex AI Gemini API

First, initialize the client using the default settings:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#include ../samples/src/gemini.rs:text-prompt-client}}
```

Then build the model name. For simplicity, this example receives the project ID
as an argument and uses a fixed location (`global`) and model id
(`gemini-2.0-flash-001`).

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#include ../samples/src/gemini.rs:text-prompt-model}}
```

If you want to run this function in your own code, use the project id (without
any `projects/` prefix) of the project you selected while going through the
prerequisites.

With the client initialized you can send the request:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#include ../samples/src/gemini.rs:text-prompt-request}}
```

And then print the response. You can use the `:#?` format specifier to prettify
the nested response objects:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#include ../samples/src/gemini.rs:text-prompt-response}}
```

See [below](#text-prompt-complete-code) for the complete code.

## Send a prompt and an image to the Vertex AI Gemini API

As in the previous example, initialize the client using the default settings:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#include ../samples/src/gemini.rs:prompt-and-image-client}}
```

And then build the model name:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#include ../samples/src/gemini.rs:prompt-and-image-model}}
```

The new request includes an image part:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#include ../samples/src/gemini.rs:prompt-and-image-image-part}}
```

And the prompt part:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#include ../samples/src/gemini.rs:prompt-and-image-prompt-part}}
```

Send the full request:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#include ../samples/src/gemini.rs:prompt-and-image-request}}
```

As in the previous example, print the full response:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#include ../samples/src/gemini.rs:prompt-and-image-response}}
```

See [below](#prompt-and-image-complete-code) for the complete code.
