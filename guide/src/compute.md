# Using the Compute Engine API

The [Compute Engine] API allows you to create and run virtual machines (VMs) on
Google Cloud.

This guide shows you how to initialize the Compute Engine client library for
Rust, and how to perform some basic operations using the library.

## Pre-requisites

The guide assumes you have an existing [Google Cloud project] with
[billing enabled].

## Add the client library as a dependency

Use `cargo` to add the necessary dependency:

```toml
cargo add google-cloud-compute-v1
```

## List all the virtual machines

The client to create, and manipulate virtual machines is called `Instances`. You
can list all the VMs in a project using the `list()` function of this type:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../samples/src/compute/quickstart.rs:all}}
```
