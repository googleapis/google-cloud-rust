# Setting up your development environment

Prepare your environment for [Rust] app development and deployment on
Google Cloud by installing the following tools.

## Install Rust

1. To install Rust, see [Getting Started][rust-getting-started].

1. Confirm that you have the most recent version of Rust installed:

   ```shell
   cargo --version
   ```

## Install an editor

The [Getting Started][rust-getting-started] guide links popular editor plugins
and IDEs, which provide the following features:

- Fully integrated debugging capabilities
- Syntax highlighting
- Code completion

## Install the Google Cloud CLI

The [Google Cloud CLI] is a set of tools for Google Cloud. It contains the
[`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/)
and [`bq`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bq-command-line-tool)
command-line tools used to access Compute Engine, Cloud Storage,
BigQuery, and other services from the command line. You can run these
tools interactively or in your automated scripts.

To install the gcloud CLI, see [Installing the gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install).

## Install the Cloud Client Libraries for Rust in a New Project

The [Cloud Client Libraries for Rust] is the idiomatic way for Rust developers
to integrate with Google Cloud services, such as Secret Manager and Workflows.

For example, to use the package for an individual API, such as the
Secret Manager API, do the following:

1. Create a new Rust project:

   ```shell
   cargo new my-project
   ```

1. Change your directory to the new project:

   ```shell
   cd my-project
   ```

1. Add the [Secret Manager] client library to the new project

   ```shell
   cargo add gcp-sdk-secretmanager-v1 --features unstable-stream
   ```

1. Add the [tokio] crate to the new project

   ```shell
   cargo add tokio --features macros
   ```

1. Edit `src/main.rs` in your project to use the Secret Manager client library:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#include ../samples/src/bin/getting_started.rs:all}}
```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->

6. Build your program:

   ```shell
   cargo build
   ```

   The program should build without errors.

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD029 -->

Note: The source of the Cloud Client Libraries for Rust is
[on GitHub](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-rust).

### Running the program

1. To use the Cloud Client Libraries in a local development environment, set
   up Application Default Credentials.

   ```shell
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

   For more information, see
   [Authenticate for using client libraries][authn-client-libraries].

1. Run your program, replacing `[PROJECT ID]` with the id of your project:

   ```shell
   cargo run [PROJECT ID]
   ```
