# Configuring Retry Policies

The Google Cloud client libraries for Rust can automatically retry operations
that fail due to transient errors. However, the clients do not automatically
enable the retry loop. The application must set the retry policy to enable
this feature.

This guide will show you how to enable the retry loop. First we will show how
to enable a common retry policy for all requests in a client, and then how to
override this default for a specific request.

## Prerequisites

The guide uses the [Secret Manager] service. That makes the examples more
concrete and therefore easier to follow. With that said, the same ideas work for
any other service.

You may want to follow the service [quickstart]. This guide will walk you
through the steps necessary to enable the service, ensure you have logged in,
and that your account has the necessary permissions.

## Dependencies

As it is usual with Rust, you must declare the dependency in your
`Cargo.toml` file. We use:

```toml
{{#include ../samples/Cargo.toml:secretmanager}}
```

## Configuring the default retry policy

In this example we will use the [`Aip194Strict`] policy, as the name implies
this policy is based on the guidelines in [`AIP-194`]. The policy is fairly
conservative, and will not retry any error that indicates the request *may* have
reached the service, **unless** the request is idempotent. As such, the policy
is safe to use as a default. The only downside may be additional requests to the
service, consuming some quota and billing.

To make this the default policy for the service, set the policy during the
client initialization:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../samples/src/retry_policies.rs:client-retry-client}}
```

Then use the service as usual:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../samples/src/retry_policies.rs:client-retry-request}}
```

See [below](#configuring-the-default-retry-policy-complete-code)
for the complete code.

## Configuring the default retry policy with limits

The [`Aip194Strict`] policy does not limit the number of retry attempts or the
time spent retrying requests. However, it can be decorated to set such limits.
For example, you can limit *both* the number of attempts and the time spent in
the retry loop using::

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../samples/src/retry_policies.rs:client-retry-full-client}}
```

Requests work as usual too:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../samples/src/retry_policies.rs:client-retry-full-request}}
```

See [below](#configuring-the-default-retry-policy-with-limits-complete-code)
for the complete code.

## Override the retry policy for one request

Sometimes applications need to override the retry policy for a specific request.
For example, the application developer may know specific details of the service
or application and determine it is safe to tolerate more errors.

For example, deleting a secret is idempotent, because it can only succeed once.
But the client library assumes all delete operations are unsafe. The application
can override the policy for one request:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../samples/src/retry_policies.rs:request-retry-request}}
```

See [below](#configuring-the-default-retry-policy-with-limits-complete-code)
for the complete code.
