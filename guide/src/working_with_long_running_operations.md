# Working with long-running operations

Occasionally, an API may need to expose a method that takes a significant amount
of time to complete. In these situations, it is often a poor user experience to
simply block while the task runs; rather, it is better to return some kind of
promise to the user and allow the user to check back in later.

The Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust provide helpers to work with these
long-running operations (LROs). This guide will show you how to start LROs and
wait for their completion.

## Prerequisites

The guide uses the [Speech-To-Text V2] service to keep the code snippets
concrete. The same ideas work for any other service using LROs.

We recommend you first follow one of the service guides, such as
[Transcribe speech to text by using the command line]. These guides will cover
critical topics such as ensuring your project has the API enabled, your account
has the right permissions, and how to set up billing for your project (if
needed). Skipping the service guides may result in problems that are hard to
diagnose.

## Dependencies

As it is usual with Rust, you must declare the dependency in your
`Cargo.toml` file. We use:

```toml
{{#include ../samples/Cargo.toml:speech}}
```

## Starting a long-running operation

To start a long-running operation first initialize a client as
[usual](./initialize_a_client.md) and then make the RPC. But first, add some
use declarations to avoid the long package names:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../samples/src/lro.rs:use}}
```

Now create the client:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../samples/src/lro.rs:client}}
```

We will use [batch recognize] in this example. While this is designed for long
audio files, it works well with small files too.

In Rust, each request is represented by a method that returns a request builder.
First, call the right method on the client to create the request builder. We
will use the default [recognizer] (`_`) in the `global` region.

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../samples/src/lro.rs:request-builder}}
```

Then initialize the request to use a publicly available audio file:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../samples/src/lro.rs:audio-file}}
```

Configure the request to return the transcripts inline:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../samples/src/lro.rs:transcript-output}}
```

Then configure the service to transcribe to US English, using the [short model]
and some other default configuration:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../samples/src/lro.rs:configuration}}
```

Then make the request and wait for [Operation][longrunning::model::operation] to
be returned. This `Operation` acts as the promise to the result of the
long-running request:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../samples/src/lro.rs:send}}
```

Finally, we need to poll this promise until it completes:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../samples/src/lro.rs:call-manual}}
```

We will examine the `manual_poll_lro()` function in the
[Manually polling a long-running operation] section.

You can find the [full function](#automatically-polling-a-long-running-operation-complete-code) below.

## Automatically polling a long-running operation

Spoiler, preparing the request will be identical to how we started a
long-running operation. The difference will come at the end, where instead of
sending the request to get the `Operation` promise:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../samples/src/lro.rs:send}}
```

... we create a `Poller` and wait until it is done:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../samples/src/lro.rs:automatic-poller-until-done}}
```

Let's review the code step-by-step, without spoilers this time.

First, we introduce the trait in scope via a `use` declaration:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../samples/src/lro.rs:automatic-use}}
```

Then we initialize the client and prepare the request as before:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../samples/src/lro.rs:automatic-prepare}}
```

And then we poll until the operation is completed and print the result:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../samples/src/lro.rs:automatic-print}}
```

You can find the [full function](#automatically-polling-a-long-running-operation-complete-code) below.

## Polling a long-running operation

While `.until_done()` is convenient, it omits some information: long-running
operations may report partial progress via a "metadata" attribute. If your
application requires such information, you need to use the poller directly:

```rust,ignore
    let mut poller = client
        .batch_recognize(/* stuff */)
        /* more stuff */
        .poller();
```

Then use the poller in a loop:

```rust,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../samples/src/lro.rs:polling-loop}}
```

Note how this loop explicitly waits before polling again. The polling period
depends on the specific operation and its payload. You should consult the
service documentation and/or experiment with your own data to determine a good
value.

The poller uses a policy to determine what polling errors are transient and may
resolve themselves. The [Configuring polling policies] chapter covers this topic
in detail.

You can find the [full function](#polling-a-long-running-operation-complete-code) below.

## Manually polling a long-running operation

In general, we recommend you use the previous two approaches in your
application. Manually polling a long-running operation can be quite tedious, and
it is easy to get the types involved wrong. If you do need to manually poll
a long-running operation this guide will walk you through the required steps.
You may want to read the [Operation][longrunning::model::operation] message
reference documentation, as some of the fields and types are used below.

Recall that we started the long-running operation using the client:

```rust,ignore
    let mut operation = client
        .batch_recognize(/* stuff */)
        /* more stuff */
        .send()
        .await?;
```

We are going to start a loop to poll the `operation`, and we need to check if
the operation completed immediately, this is rare but does happen. The `done`
field indicates if the operation completed:

```rust,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../samples/src/lro.rs:manual-if-done}}
```

In most cases, if the operation is done it contains a result. However, the field
is optional because the service could return `done` as true and no result: maybe
the operation deletes resources and a successful completion has no return value.
In our example, with the Speech-to-Text service, we treat this as an error:

```rust,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../samples/src/lro.rs:manual-match-none}}
```

Starting a long-running operation successfully does not guarantee that it will
complete successfully. The result may be an error or a valid response. We need
to check for both. First check for errors:

```rust,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../samples/src/lro.rs:manual-match-error}}
```

The error type is a [Status][rpc::model::status] message type. This does **not**
implement the standard `Error` interface, you need to manually convert that to
a valid error. You can use [ServiceError::from] to perform this conversion.

Assuming the result is successful, you need to extract the response type. You
can find this type in the documentation for the LRO method, or by reading the
service API documentation:

```rust,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../samples/src/lro.rs:manual-match-success}}
```

Note that extraction of the value may fail if the type does not match what the
service sent.

All types in Google Cloud may add fields and branches in the future. While this
is unlikely for a common type such as `Operation`, it happens frequently for
most service messages. The Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust mark all
structs and enums as `#[non_exhaustive]` to signal that such changes are
possible. In this case, you must handle this unexpected case:

```rust,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../samples/src/lro.rs:manual-match-default}}
```

If the operation has not completed, then it may contain some metadata. Some
services just include initial information about the request, while other
services include partial progress reports. You can choose to extract and report
this metadata:

```rust,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../samples/src/lro.rs:manual-metadata}}
```

As the operation has not completed, you need to wait before polling again.
Consider adjusting the polling period, maybe using a form of truncated
[exponential backoff]. In this example we simply poll every 500ms:

```rust,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../samples/src/lro.rs:manual-backoff}}
```

And then poll the operation to get its new status:

```rust,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../samples/src/lro.rs:manual-poll-again}}
```

For simplicity, we have chosen to ignore all errors. In your application you
may choose to treat only a subset of the errors as non-recoverable, and may want
to limit the number of polling attempts if these fail.
