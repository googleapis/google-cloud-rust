# Setting up Rust on Cloud Shell

Cloud Shell is a great environment to run small examples and tests. This guide
shows you how to configure Rust and install one of the Cloud Client Libraries in
Cloud Shell.

## Start up Cloud Shell

1. In the Google Cloud console [project selector], select a project.

1. Open <https://shell.cloud.google.com> to start a new shell. You might be
   prompted to [authorize Cloud Shell] to use your credentials for Google Cloud
   API calls.

## Configure Rust

1. [Cloud Shell] comes with [rustup] pre-installed. You can use it to install
   and configure the default version of Rust:

   ```shell
   rustup default stable
   ```

1. Confirm that you have the most recent version of Rust installed:

   ```shell
   cargo --version
   ```

## Install Rust client libraries in Cloud Shell

1. Create a new Rust project:

   ```shell
   cargo new my-project
   ```

1. Change your directory to the new project:

   ```shell
   cd my-project
   ```

1. Add the [Secret Manager] client library to the new project:

   ```shell
   cargo add google-cloud-secretmanager-v1
   ```

1. Add the [google-cloud-gax] crate to the new project:

   ```shell
   cargo add google-cloud-gax
   ```

1. Add the [tokio] crate to the new project:

   ```shell
   cargo add tokio --features macros
   ```

1. Edit `src/main.rs` in your project to use the Secret Manager client library:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#include ../samples/src/bin/getting_started.rs:all}}
```

6. Run your program, replacing `[PROJECT ID]` with the id of your project:

   ```shell
   cargo run [PROJECT ID]
   ```

   The program will print the secrets associated with your project ID. If you
   don't see any secrets, you might not have any in Secret Manager. You can
   [create a secret] and rerun the program, and you should see the secret
   printed in the output.
