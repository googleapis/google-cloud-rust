# How to initialize a client

The Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust use "clients" as the main
abstraction to interface with specific services. Clients are implemented
as Rust structs, with methods corresponding to each RPC offered by the
service. In other words, to use a Google Cloud service using the Rust
client libraries you need to first initialize a client.

## Prerequisites

In this guide we will initialize a client and then use the client to make
a simple RPC. To make this guide concrete, we will use the
[Secret Manager API]. The same structure applies to any other service in
Google Cloud.

We recommend you follow one of the "Getting Started" guides for Secret Manager
before attempting to use the client library, such as how to [Create a secret].
These guides cover service specific concepts in more detail, and provide
detailed instructions with respect to project prerequisites than we can fit in
this guide.

We also recommend you follow the instructions in the
[Authenticate for using client libraries] guide. This guide will show you how to
login to configure the [Application Default Credentials] used in this guide.

## Dependencies

As it is usual with rust, you must declare the dependency in your
`Cargo.toml` file. We use:

```toml
{{#include ../samples/Cargo.toml:secretmanager}}
```

The default initialization is designed to meet the requirements for most
cases. You create a default client using `new()`:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#include ../samples/tests/initialize_client.rs:new-client}}
```

Once successfully initialized, you can use this client to make RPCs:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#include ../samples/tests/initialize_client.rs:make-rpc}}
```

## Full Program

Putting all this code together into a full program looks as follows:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#include ../samples/tests/initialize_client.rs:all}}
```
