# Handling binding errors

You might have tried to make a request and run into an error that looks like:

```norust
Error: cannot find a matching binding to send the request: at least one of the
conditions must be met: (1) field `name` needs to be set and match the template:
'projects/*/secrets/*' OR (2) field `name` needs to be set and match the
template: 'projects/*/locations/*/secrets/*'
```

This guide will explain how to troubleshoot this type of error.

## When this happens

The Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust primarily use HTTP to send requests
to Google Cloud services.

Some RPCs correspond to multiple [URI]s. The contents of the request determine
which URI is used.

The client library considers all possible URIs, and only returns a binding error
if no URIs work. Typically this happens when a field is either missing, or in an
invalid format.

The example error above was produced by trying to get a resource, without naming
the resource. Specifically, the `name` field on a [`GetSecretRequest`] was
required, but not set.

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../samples/src/binding_errors.rs:request}}
```

## How to fix it

To fix the code, we need to set the `name` field to something matching one of
the above templates. Either will allow the client library to make a request to
the server.

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../samples/src/binding_errors.rs:request-success-1}}
```

OR

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../samples/src/binding_errors.rs:request-success-2}}
```

## Interpreting the templates

The error message includes a number of "template strings" showing possible
values for the request fields. Most template strings include `*` and `**` as
wildcards to match the field values.

### Single wildcard

The `*` wildcard alone means: a non-empty string without a `/`. It can be
thought of as the regex `[^/]+`.

Here are some examples:

| Template                   | Input                         | Match?  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------- |
| `"*"`                      | `"simple-string-123"`         | `true`  |
| `"projects/*"`             | `"projects/p"`                | `true`  |
| `"projects/*/locations"`   | `"projects/p/locations"`      | `true`  |
| `"projects/*/locations/*"` | `"projects/p/locations/l"`    | `true`  |
| `"*"`                      | `""` (empty)                  | `false` |
| `"*"`                      | `"string/with/slashes"`       | `false` |
| `"projects/*"`             | `"projects/"` (empty)         | `false` |
| `"projects/*"`             | `"projects/p/"` (extra slash) | `false` |
| `"projects/*"`             | `"projects/p/locations/l"`    | `false` |
| `"projects/*/locations"`   | `"projects/p"`                | `false` |
| `"projects/*/locations"`   | `"projects/p/locations/l"`    | `false` |

### Double wildcard

Less common is the `**` wildcard, which means: any string. The string can be
empty or contain any number of `/`'s. It can be thought of as the regex `.*`.

Also, when a template ends in `/**`, that initial slash is optionally included.

| Template          | Input                      | Match?  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------- |
| `"**"`            | `""`                       | `true`  |
| `"**"`            | `"simple-string-123"`      | `true`  |
| `"**"`            | `"string/with/slashes"`    | `true`  |
| `"projects/*/**"` | `"projects/p"`             | `true`  |
| `"projects/*/**"` | `"projects/p/locations"`   | `true`  |
| `"projects/*/**"` | `"projects/p/locations/l"` | `true`  |
| `"projects/*/**"` | `"locations/l"`            | `false` |
| `"projects/*/**"` | `"projects//locations/l"`  | `false` |

## Inspecting the error

If you need to inspect the error programmatically, you can do so by checking
that it is a binding error, then downcasting it to a `BindingError`.

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../samples/src/binding_errors.rs:inspect}}
```
