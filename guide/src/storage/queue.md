# Push data on object uploads

The client API to upload [Cloud Storage] objects pull the upload data from a
type provided by the application. In some applications the data is generated by
a thread that where it would be easier to "push" the object payload.

This guide will show you how to upload an object to [Cloud Storage] using a push
data source.

## Prerequisites

The guide assumes you have an existing [Google Cloud project] with
[billing enabled], and a Cloud Storage bucket in that project.

## Add the client library as a dependency

```toml
{{#include ../../samples/Cargo.toml:storage}}
```

## Convert a queue to an upload source

The key idea is to use a queue to separate the task pushing new data from the
task pulling the upload data. This tutorial uses a Tokio [mpsc queue], but you
can use any queue that integrates with Tokio's async runtime.

First wrap the receiver in our own type:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../../samples/tests/storage/queue.rs:wrapper-struct}}
```

Then implement the trait required by the Google Cloud client library:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../../samples/tests/storage/queue.rs:impl-streaming-source}}
```

In this tutorial you write the rest of the code in a function that accepts the
bucket and object name as parameters:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../../samples/tests/storage/queue.rs:begin-sample-function}}
    // ... code goes here ...
{{#rustdoc_include ../../samples/tests/storage/queue.rs:end-sample-function}}
```

As usual you initialize a client for the upload:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../../samples/tests/storage/queue.rs:client}}
```

Create a queue, obtaining the receiver and sender:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../../samples/tests/storage/queue.rs:create-queue}}
```

Use the client to upload the data received from this queue. Note that we do not
`await` the future created in the `upload_object()` method.

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../../samples/tests/storage/queue.rs:create-upload}}
```

Create a task to process the queue and upload the data in the background:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../../samples/tests/storage/queue.rs:create-task}}
```

In the main task, send some data to upload:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../../samples/tests/storage/queue.rs:send-data}}
```

Once you have finished sending the data, drop the sender to close the sending
side of the queue:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../../samples/tests/storage/queue.rs:close}}
```

Now you can wait for the task to finish and extract the result:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../../samples/tests/storage/queue.rs:wait}}
```

## Full program

Putting all these steps together you get:

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../../samples/tests/storage/queue.rs:all}}
```
