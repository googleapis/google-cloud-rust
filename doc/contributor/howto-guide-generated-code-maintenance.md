# How-To Guide: Generated Code Maintenance

This guide is intended for contributors to the `google-cloud-rust` SDK. It will
walk you through the steps necessary to generate a new library, update libraries
with new changes in the proto specifications, and refresh the generated code
when the generator changes.

## Generate new library

We will use "Web Security Scanner" as an example, most likely you will generate
a different library, change the paths as needed:

```bash
go -C generator/ run ./cmd/sidekick -project-root .. \
    -specification-source google/cloud/websecurityscanner/v1 \
    -service-config google/cloud/websecurityscanner/v1/websecurityscanner_v1.yaml \
    -output src/generated/websecurityscanner/v1 \
    generate
```

Edit the top-level `Cargo.toml` file and add the new directory.

```bash
git diff Cargo.toml
diff --git a/Cargo.toml b/Cargo.toml
index 44e101c..f03160b 100644
--- a/Cargo.toml
+++ b/Cargo.toml

   "src/generated/api",
   "src/generated/openapi-validation",
+  "src/generated/websecurityscanner/v1",
   "src/integration-tests",
 ]
```

Add the files to `git`, compile them, and run the tests:

```bash
git add src/generated/websecurityscanner/v1
cargo build
cargo test
cargo doc
```

## Update the code with new googleapis protos

Run:

```bash
go -C generator/ run ./cmd/sidekick -project-root .. update && taplo fmt .sidekick.toml && cargo fmt
```

Then run the unit tests and send a PR with whatever changed.

## Refreshing the code

Run:

```bash
go -C generator/ run ./cmd/sidekick -project-root .. refreshall && cargo fmt
```

Then run the unit tests and send a PR with whatever changed.

## The Glorious Future

Someday `sidekick` will be stable enough that (a) it will not be part of the
`google-cloud-rust` repository, and we will be able to install it. At that
point we will be able to say:

```bash
go install github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-generator/sidekick@v1.0.0
```

And we will be able to issue shorter commands, such as:

```bash
sidekick update && taplo fmt .sidekick.toml && cargo fmt
```
