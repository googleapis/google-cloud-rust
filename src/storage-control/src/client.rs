//! Contains the Storage client and related types.

/// Implements a client for the Cloud Storage API.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// # tokio_test::block_on(async {
/// # use google_cloud_storage_control::client::Storage;
/// let client = Storage::builder().build().await?;
/// // use `client` to make requests to Cloud Storage.
/// # gax::Result::<()>::Ok(()) });
/// ```
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// To configure `Storage` use the `with_*` methods in the type returned
/// by [builder()][Storage::builder]. The default configuration should
/// work for most applications. Common configuration changes include
///
/// * [with_endpoint()]: by default this client uses the global default endpoint
///   (`https://storage.googleapis.com`). Applications using regional
///   endpoints or running in restricted networks (e.g. a network configured
//    with [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]) may want to
///   override this default.
/// * [with_credentials()]: by default this client uses
///   [Application Default Credentials]. Applications using custom
///   authentication may need to override this default.
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `Storage` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `Storage` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc](std::sync::Arc) to reuse it, because it
/// already uses an `Arc` internally.
///
/// # Service Description
///
/// The Cloud Storage API allows applications to read and write data through
/// the abstractions of buckets and objects. For a description of these
/// abstractions please see <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs>.
///
/// This client is used to perform metadata operations, such as creating
/// buckets, deleting objects, listing objects, etc. It does not expose any
/// functions to write or read data in objects.
///
/// Resources are named as follows:
///
/// - Projects are referred to as they are defined by the Resource Manager API,
///   using strings like `projects/123456` or `projects/my-string-id`.
///
/// - Buckets are named using string names of the form:
///   `projects/{project}/buckets/{bucket}`
///   For globally unique buckets, `_` may be substituted for the project.
///
/// - Objects are uniquely identified by their name along with the name of the
///   bucket they belong to, as separate strings in this API. For example:
///   ```no_rust
///   bucket = "projects/_/buckets/my-bucket"
///   object = "my-object/with/a/folder-like/name"
///   ```
///   Note that object names can contain `/` characters, which are treated as
///   any other character (no special directory semantics).
///

/// [with_credentials()]: ClientBuilder::with_credentials
