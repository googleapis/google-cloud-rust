# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Authentication

The Client Libraries for Rust are under active development. We are creating
placeholder crates so we can reference them in our code and tooling.

> This crate used to contain a different implementation, with a different
> surface. [@yoshidan](https://github.com/yoshidan) generously donated the crate
> name to Google. Their crate continues to live as [gcloud-auth].
