# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Implementation Details

This crate contains implementation details shared by many client libraries. The
types, traits, and functions defined in this crate are undocumented. This is
intentional, as they are not intended for general use and will be changed
without notice.

Maybe you were looking for [google-cloud-gax]? That crate contains public APIs
intended for general use.

This crate will remain unstable for the foreseeable future, even if used in the
implementation for stable client libraries. We (the Google Cloud Client
Libraries for Rust team) control both and will change both if needed.
