# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Storage Control

This crate implements the [Storage] client library for control plane operations.

**WARNING:** this crate is under active development. We expect multiple breaking
changes in the upcoming releases. Testing is also incomplete, we do **not**
recommend that you use this crate in production. We welcome feedback about the
APIs, documentation, missing features, bugs, etc.

**NOTE:** This crate used to contain a different implementation, with a
different surface. [@yoshidan](https://github.com/yoshidan) generously donated
the crate name to Google. Their crate continues to live as [gcloud-storage].
