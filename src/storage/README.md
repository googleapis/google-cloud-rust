# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Storage Control

This crate implements the [Storage] client library for control plane operations.

**NOTE:** This crate used to contain a different implementation, with a
different surface. [@yoshidan](https://github.com/yoshidan) generously donated
the crate name to Google. Their crate continues to live as [gcloud-storage].
