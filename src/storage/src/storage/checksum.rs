//! Define types to compute and compare Cloud Storage object checksums.
//!
//! The [ChecksumEngine] trait is sealed, and cannot be used to create new
//! implementations. However, it may be useful when working with
//! [WriteObject][crate::builder::storage::WriteObject].
//!
//! # Example
//! ```
//! use google_cloud_storage::builder::storage::WriteObject;
//! use google_cloud_storage::model::Object;
//! use google_cloud_storage::{streaming_source::StreamingSource, checksum::ChecksumEngine};
//!
//! async fn example<S, C>(builder: WriteObject<S, C>) -> anyhow::Result<Object>
//! where
//!     S: StreamingSource + Send + Sync + 'static,
//!     C: ChecksumEngine + Send + Sync + 'static
//! {
//!     // Finish configuring `builder` and complete the upload.
//!     let object = builder
//!         .with_if_generation_match(0)
//!         .with_resumable_upload_threshold(0_usize)
//!         .send_buffered()
//!         .await?;
//!     Ok(object)
//! }
//! ```

/// Computes a checksum or hash for [Cloud Storage] transfers.
///
/// We want to minimize code complexity in our implementation of data integrity
/// checks for writes and reads. This trait defines a composable interface
/// to support:
/// - No checksums (`Null`): the client library does not compute any checksums,
///   and therefore does not validate checksums either.
/// - Precomputed checksums (`Precomputed`): the client library assumes the
///   application provided checksums in the object metadata.
/// - Only crc32c (`Crc32c` or `Crc32c<Null>`)`: compute (and validate) only
///   crc32c checksums.
/// - Only MD5 (`Md5` or `Md5<Null>`): compute (and validate) only MD5 hashes.
/// - Both: (`Crc32c<Md5>` or `Md5<Crc32>`): compute (and validate) both crc32
///   checksums and MD5 hashes.
///
/// The application should have no need to interact with these types directly,
/// or even name them. They are used only as implementation details. They may
/// be visible in debug messages.
