//! Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Storage
//!
//! This crate contains traits, types, and functions to interact with [Google
//! Cloud Storage]. Most applications will use the structs defined in the
//! [client] module. More specifically:
//!
//! * [Storage][client::Storage]
//! * [StorageControl][client::StorageControl]
//!
//! **WARNING:** this crate is under active development. We expect multiple
//! breaking changes in the upcoming releases. Testing is also incomplete, we do
//! **not** recommend that you use this crate in production. We welcome feedback
//! about the APIs, documentation, missing features, bugs, etc.
//!
//! **NOTE:** This crate used to contain a different implementation, with a
//! different surface. [@yoshidan](https://github.com/yoshidan) generously
//! donated the crate name to Google. Their crate continues to live as
//! [gcloud-storage].
//!
