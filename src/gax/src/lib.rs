//! Google APIs eXtensions for Rust.
//!
//! **WARNING:** this crate is under active development. We expect multiple
//! breaking changes in the upcoming releases. Testing is also incomplete, we do
//! **not** recommend that you use this crate in production. We welcome feedback
//! about the APIs, documentation, missing features, bugs, etc.
//!
//! This crate contains a number of types and functions used in the
//! implementation of the Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust.
//!
//! <div class="warning">
//! All the types, traits, and functions defined in the <code>unstable-sdk-client</code>
//! feature are <b>not</b> intended for general use. The APIs enabled by this
//! feature will remain unstable for the foreseeable future, even if used in
//! stable SDKs. We (the Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust team) control both and will
//! change both if needed.
