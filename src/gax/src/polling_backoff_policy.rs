//! Defines the trait for polling backoff policies and a common implementations.
//!
//! The client libraries can automatically poll long-running operations (LROs)
//! until completion. When doing so they may backoff between polling to avoid
//! overloading the service.
//!
//! These policies should not be confused with retry backoff policies. Their
//! purpose is different, and their implementation is too. Notably, polling
//! backoff policies should not use jitter, while retry policies should.
//!
//! The most common implementation is truncated [exponential backoff]
//! **without** jitter. The backoff period grows exponentially until some limit
//! is reached. This works well when the expected execution time is not known
//! in advance.
//!
//! # Example
//! ```
//! # use gcp_sdk_gax::*;
//! # use polling_backoff_policy::*;
//! use exponential_backoff::ExponentialBackoffBuilder;
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! fn configure_polling(config: options::ClientConfig) -> Result<options::ClientConfig> {
//!     let policy = ExponentialBackoffBuilder::new()
//!         .with_initial_delay(Duration::from_millis(100))
//!         .with_maximum_delay(Duration::from_secs(5))
//!         .with_scaling(4.0)
//!         .build()?;
//!     Ok(config.set_polling_backoff_policy(policy))
//! }
//! ```
