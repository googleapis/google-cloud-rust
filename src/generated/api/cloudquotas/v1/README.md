# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Cloud Quotas API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**FEEDBACK WANTED:** We believe the APIs in this crate are stable, and
do not anticipate any breaking changes are needed. We are looking for
feedback before labeling the APIs "1.0". Changes (even breaking changes)
are still possible, but not expected.

We also believe the implementation is ready for production, bugs are
still possible, but not expected.

Cloud Quotas API provides Google Cloud service consumers with management
and observability for resource usage, quotas, and restrictions of the
services they consume.
