# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Service Management API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**FEEDBACK WANTED:** We believe the APIs in this crate are stable, and
do not anticipate any breaking changes are needed. We are looking for
feedback before labeling the APIs "1.0". Changes (even breaking changes)
are still possible, but not expected.

We also believe the implementation is ready for production, bugs are
still possible, but not expected.

Google Service Management allows service producers to publish their
services on Google Cloud Platform so that they can be discovered and used
by service consumers.

## Quickstart

The main types to work with this crate are the clients:

- [ServiceManager]
