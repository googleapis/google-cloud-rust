/// # Service Description
///
/// [Service Control API
/// v2](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/service-control/access-control)
///
/// Private Preview. This feature is only available for approved services.
///
/// This API provides admission control and telemetry reporting for services
/// that are integrated with [Service
/// Infrastructure](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure).
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// `ServiceController` has various configuration parameters, the defaults should
/// work with most applications.
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `ServiceController` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `ServiceController` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
