/// Implements a client for the Service Control API.

/// # Example
/// ```
/// # tokio_test::block_on(async {
/// # use google_cloud_api_servicecontrol_v2::client::ServiceController;
/// let client = ServiceController::builder().build().await?;
/// // use `client` to make requests to the Service Control API.

///
/// # Service Description
///
/// [Service Control API
/// v2](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/service-control/access-control)
///
/// Private Preview. This feature is only available for approved services.
///
/// This API provides admission control and telemetry reporting for services
/// that are integrated with [Service
/// Infrastructure](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure).
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// To configure `ServiceController` use the `with_*` methods in the type returned
/// by [builder()][ServiceController::builder]. The default configuration should
/// work for most applications. Common configuration changes include
///
/// * [with_endpoint()]: by default this client uses the global default endpoint
///   (`https://servicecontrol.googleapis.com`). Applications using regional
///   endpoints or running in restricted networks (e.g. a network configured
//    with [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]) may want to
///   override this default.
/// * [with_credentials()]: by default this client uses
///   [Application Default Credentials]. Applications using custom
///   authentication may need to override this default.
///
/// [with_endpoint()]: super::builder::service_controller::ClientBuilder::with_endpoint
/// [with_credentials()]: super::builder::service_controller::ClientBuilder::credentials
/// [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]: https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/private-connectivity
/// [Application Default Credentials]: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#adc
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `ServiceController` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `ServiceController` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc](std::sync::Arc) to reuse it, because it
/// already uses an `Arc` internally.
