description-override = """Defines types and an abstract service to handle long-running operations.

[Long-running operations] are a common pattern to handle methods that may take a
significant amount of time to execute. Many Google APIs return an `Operation`
message (defined in this crate) that are roughly analogous to a future. The
operation will eventually complete, though it may still return an error on
completion. The client libraries provide helpers to simplify polling of these
operations.

> This crate used to contain a different implementation, with a different
> surface. [@yoshidan](https://github.com/yoshidan) generously donated the crate
> name to Google. Their crate continues to live as [gcloud-longrunning].
