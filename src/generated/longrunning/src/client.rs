/// Implements a client for the Long Running Operations API.
///
/// # Service Description
///
/// Manages long-running operations with an API service.
///
/// When an API method normally takes long time to complete, it can be designed
/// to return [Operation][google.longrunning.Operation] to the client, and the
/// client can use this interface to receive the real response asynchronously by
/// polling the operation resource, or pass the operation resource to another API
/// (such as Pub/Sub API) to receive the response.  Any API service that returns
/// long-running operations should implement the `Operations` interface so
/// developers can have a consistent client experience.
///
/// [google.longrunning.Operation]: crate::model::Operation
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// `Operations` has various configuration parameters, the defaults should
/// work with most applications.
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `Operations` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `Operations` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
