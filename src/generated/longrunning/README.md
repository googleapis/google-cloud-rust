# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Long Running Operations API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**WARNING:** this crate is under active development. We expect multiple breaking
changes in the upcoming releases. Testing is also incomplete, we do **not**
recommend that you use this crate in production. We welcome feedback about the
APIs, documentation, missing features, bugs, etc.

Defines types and an abstract service to handle long-running operations.

[Long-running operations] are a common pattern to handle methods that may take a
significant amount of time to execute. Many Google APIs return an `Operation`
message (defined in this crate) that are roughly analogous to a future. The
operation will eventually complete, though it may still return an error on
completion. The client libraries provide helpers to simplify polling of these
operations.

> This crate used to contain a different implementation, with a different
> surface. [@yoshidan](https://github.com/yoshidan) generously donated the crate
> name to Google. Their crate continues to live as [gcloud-longrunning].
