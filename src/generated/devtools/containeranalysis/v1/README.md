# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Container Analysis API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**WARNING:** this crate is under active development. We expect multiple breaking
changes in the upcoming releases. Testing is also incomplete, we do **not**
recommend that you use this crate in production. We welcome feedback about the
APIs, documentation, missing features, bugs, etc.

This API is a prerequisite for leveraging Artifact Analysis
scanning capabilities in both Artifact Registry and with Advanced
Vulnerability Insights (runtime scanning) in GKE.

In addition, the Container Analysis API is an implementation of the
Grafeas API, which enables storing, querying, and retrieval of critical
metadata
about all of your software artifacts.
