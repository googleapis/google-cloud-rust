/// Implements a client for the Container Analysis API.
///
/// # Service Description
///
/// Retrieves analysis results of Cloud components such as Docker container
/// images. The Container Analysis API is an implementation of the
/// [Grafeas](https://grafeas.io) API.
///
/// Analysis results are stored as a series of occurrences. An `Occurrence`
/// contains information about a specific analysis instance on a resource. An
/// occurrence refers to a `Note`. A note contains details describing the
/// analysis and is generally stored in a separate project, called a `Provider`.
/// Multiple occurrences can refer to the same note.
///
/// For example, an SSL vulnerability could affect multiple images. In this case,
/// there would be one note for the vulnerability and an occurrence for each
/// image with the vulnerability referring to that note.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// `ContainerAnalysis` has various configuration parameters, the defaults should
/// work with most applications.
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `ContainerAnalysis` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `ContainerAnalysis` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
