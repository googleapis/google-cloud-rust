/// Implements a client for the Stackdriver Trace API.
///
/// # Service Description
///
/// Service for collecting and viewing traces and spans within a trace.
///
/// A trace is a collection of spans corresponding to a single
/// operation or a set of operations in an application.
///
/// A span is an individual timed event which forms a node of the trace tree.
/// A single trace can contain spans from multiple services.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// `TraceService` has various configuration parameters, the defaults should
/// work with most applications.
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `TraceService` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `TraceService` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
