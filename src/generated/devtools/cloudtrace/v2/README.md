Sends application trace data to Stackdriver Trace for viewing. Trace data
is collected for all App Engine applications by default. Trace data from
other applications can be provided using this API. This library is used to
interact with the Trace API directly. If you are looking to instrument
your application for Stackdriver Trace, we recommend using OpenTelemetry.
