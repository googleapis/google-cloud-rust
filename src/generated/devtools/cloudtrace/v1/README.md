# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Stackdriver Trace API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->


Sends application trace data to Stackdriver Trace for viewing. Trace data
is collected for all App Engine applications by default. Trace data from
other applications can be provided using this API. This library is used to
interact with the Trace API directly. If you are looking to instrument
your application for Stackdriver Trace, we recommend using OpenTelemetry.

The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client
libraries are designed to preserve backwards compatibility when the service
changes in compatible ways. For example, adding RPCs, or fields to messages
should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.

## Quickstart

The main types to work with this crate are the clients:
