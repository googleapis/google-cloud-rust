/// Implements a client for the Artifact Registry API.
///
/// # Service Description
///
/// The Artifact Registry API service.
///
/// Artifact Registry is an artifact management system for storing artifacts
/// from different package management systems.
///
/// The resources managed by this API are:
///
/// * Repositories, which group packages and their data.
/// * Packages, which group versions and their tags.
/// * Versions, which are specific forms of a package.
/// * Tags, which represent alternative names for versions.
/// * Files, which contain content and are optionally associated with a Package
///   or Version.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// `ArtifactRegistry` has various configuration parameters, the defaults should
/// work with most applications.
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `ArtifactRegistry` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `ArtifactRegistry` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
