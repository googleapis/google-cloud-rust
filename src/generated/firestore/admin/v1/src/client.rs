/// Implements a client for the Cloud Firestore API.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// # tokio_test::block_on(async {
/// # use google_cloud_firestore_admin_v1::client::FirestoreAdmin;
/// let client = FirestoreAdmin::builder().build().await?;
/// // use `client` to make requests to the Cloud Firestore API.
/// # gax::client_builder::Result::<()>::Ok(()) });
/// ```
///
/// # Service Description
///
/// The Cloud Firestore Admin API.
///
/// This API provides several administrative services for Cloud Firestore.
///
/// Project, Database, Namespace, Collection, Collection Group, and Document are
/// used as defined in the Google Cloud Firestore API.
///
/// Operation: An Operation represents work being performed in the background.
///
/// The index service manages Cloud Firestore indexes.
///
/// Index creation is performed asynchronously.
/// An Operation resource is created for each such asynchronous operation.
/// The state of the operation (including any errors encountered)
/// may be queried via the Operation resource.
///
/// The Operations collection provides a record of actions performed for the
/// specified Project (including any Operations in progress). Operations are not
/// created directly but through calls on other collections or resources.
///
/// An Operation that is done may be deleted so that it is no longer listed as
/// part of the Operation collection. Operations are garbage collected after
/// 30 days. By default, ListOperations will only return in progress and failed
/// operations. To list completed operation, issue a ListOperations request with
/// the filter `done: true`.
///
/// Operations are created by service `FirestoreAdmin`, but are accessed via
/// service `google.longrunning.Operations`.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// To configure `FirestoreAdmin` use the `with_*` methods in the type returned
/// by [builder()][FirestoreAdmin::builder]. The default configuration should
/// work for most applications. Common configuration changes include
///
/// * [with_endpoint()]: by default this client uses the global default endpoint
///   (`https://firestore.googleapis.com`). Applications using regional
///   endpoints or running in restricted networks (e.g. a network configured
//    with [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]) may want to
///   override this default.
/// * [with_credentials()]: by default this client uses
///   [Application Default Credentials]. Applications using custom
///   authentication may need to override this default.
///
/// [with_endpoint()]: super::builder::firestore_admin::ClientBuilder::with_endpoint
/// [with_credentials()]: super::builder::firestore_admin::ClientBuilder::credentials
/// [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]: https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/private-connectivity
/// [Application Default Credentials]: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#adc
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `FirestoreAdmin` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `FirestoreAdmin` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc](std::sync::Arc) to reuse it, because it
/// already uses an `Arc` internally.
