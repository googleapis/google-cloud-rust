/// Implements a client for the Cloud Firestore API.
///
/// # Service Description
///
/// The Cloud Firestore Admin API.
///
/// This API provides several administrative services for Cloud Firestore.
///
/// Project, Database, Namespace, Collection, Collection Group, and Document are
/// used as defined in the Google Cloud Firestore API.
///
/// Operation: An Operation represents work being performed in the background.
///
/// The index service manages Cloud Firestore indexes.
///
/// Index creation is performed asynchronously.
/// An Operation resource is created for each such asynchronous operation.
/// The state of the operation (including any errors encountered)
/// may be queried via the Operation resource.
///
/// The Operations collection provides a record of actions performed for the
/// specified Project (including any Operations in progress). Operations are not
/// created directly but through calls on other collections or resources.
///
/// An Operation that is done may be deleted so that it is no longer listed as
/// part of the Operation collection. Operations are garbage collected after
/// 30 days. By default, ListOperations will only return in progress and failed
/// operations. To list completed operation, issue a ListOperations request with
/// the filter `done: true`.
///
/// Operations are created by service `FirestoreAdmin`, but are accessed via
/// service `google.longrunning.Operations`.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// `FirestoreAdmin` has various configuration parameters, the defaults should
/// work with most applications.
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `FirestoreAdmin` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `FirestoreAdmin` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
