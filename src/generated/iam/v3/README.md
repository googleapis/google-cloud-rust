# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Identity and Access Management (IAM) API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**WARNING:** this crate is under active development. We expect multiple breaking
changes in the upcoming releases. Testing is also incomplete, we do **not**
recommend that you use this crate in production. We welcome feedback about the
APIs, documentation, missing features, bugs, etc.

Manages identity and access control for Google Cloud resources, including
the creation of service accounts, which you can use to authenticate to
Google and make API calls. Enabling this API also enables the IAM Service
Account Credentials API (iamcredentials.googleapis.com). However,
disabling this API doesn't disable the IAM Service Account Credentials
API.
