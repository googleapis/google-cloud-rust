//! Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - IAM Meta API
//!
//! This crate contains traits, types, and functions to interact with IAM Meta API
//! Most applications will use the structs defined in the [client] module.
//!
//! The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
//! Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client
//! libraries are designed to preserve backwards compatibility when the service
//! changes in compatible ways. For example, adding RPCs, or fields to messages
//! should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.
//!
//! # Available Clients

//! * [IAMPolicy](client/struct.IAMPolicy.html)
