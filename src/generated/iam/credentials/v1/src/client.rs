/// Implements a client for the IAM Service Account Credentials API.
///
/// # Service Description
///
/// A service account is a special type of Google account that belongs to your
/// application or a virtual machine (VM), instead of to an individual end user.
/// Your application assumes the identity of the service account to call Google
/// APIs, so that the users aren't directly involved.
///
/// Service account credentials are used to temporarily assume the identity
/// of the service account. Supported credential types include OAuth 2.0 access
/// tokens, OpenID Connect ID tokens, self-signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), and
/// more.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// `IAMCredentials` has various configuration parameters, the defaults should
/// work with most applications.
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `IAMCredentials` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `IAMCredentials` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
