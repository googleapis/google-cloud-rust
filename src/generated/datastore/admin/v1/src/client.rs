/// Implements a client for the Cloud Datastore API.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// # async fn sample() -> gax::client_builder::Result<()> {
/// # use google_cloud_datastore_admin_v1::client::DatastoreAdmin;
/// let client = DatastoreAdmin::builder().build().await?;
/// // use `client` to make requests to the Cloud Datastore API.
/// # Ok(()) }
/// ```
///
/// # Service Description
///
/// Google Cloud Datastore Admin API
///
/// The Datastore Admin API provides several admin services for Cloud Datastore.
///
/// Concepts: Project, namespace, kind, and entity as defined in the Google Cloud
/// Datastore API.
///
/// Operation: An Operation represents work being performed in the background.
///
/// EntityFilter: Allows specifying a subset of entities in a project. This is
/// specified as a combination of kinds and namespaces (either or both of which
/// may be all).
///
/// Export/Import Service:
///
/// - The Export/Import service provides the ability to copy all or a subset of
///   entities to/from Google Cloud Storage.
/// - Exported data may be imported into Cloud Datastore for any Google Cloud
///   Platform project. It is not restricted to the export source project. It is
///   possible to export from one project and then import into another.
/// - Exported data can also be loaded into Google BigQuery for analysis.
/// - Exports and imports are performed asynchronously. An Operation resource is
///   created for each export/import. The state (including any errors encountered)
///   of the export/import may be queried via the Operation resource.
///
/// Index Service:
///
/// - The index service manages Cloud Datastore composite indexes.
/// - Index creation and deletion are performed asynchronously.
///   An Operation resource is created for each such asynchronous operation.
///   The state of the operation (including any errors encountered)
///   may be queried via the Operation resource.
///
/// Operation Service:
///
/// - The Operations collection provides a record of actions performed for the
///   specified project (including any operations in progress). Operations are not
///   created directly but through calls on other collections or resources.
/// - An operation that is not yet done may be cancelled. The request to cancel
///   is asynchronous and the operation may continue to run for some time after the
///   request to cancel is made.
/// - An operation that is done may be deleted so that it is no longer listed as
///   part of the Operation collection.
/// - ListOperations returns all pending operations, but not completed
///   operations.
/// - Operations are created by service DatastoreAdmin, but are accessed via
///   service google.longrunning.Operations.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// To configure `DatastoreAdmin` use the `with_*` methods in the type returned
/// by [builder()][DatastoreAdmin::builder]. The default configuration should
/// work for most applications. Common configuration changes include
///
/// * [with_endpoint()]: by default this client uses the global default endpoint
///   (`https://datastore.googleapis.com`). Applications using regional
///   endpoints or running in restricted networks (e.g. a network configured
//    with [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]) may want to
///   override this default.
/// * [with_credentials()]: by default this client uses
///   [Application Default Credentials]. Applications using custom
///   authentication may need to override this default.
///
/// [with_endpoint()]: super::builder::datastore_admin::ClientBuilder::with_endpoint
/// [with_credentials()]: super::builder::datastore_admin::ClientBuilder::credentials
/// [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]: https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/private-connectivity
/// [Application Default Credentials]: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#adc
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `DatastoreAdmin` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `DatastoreAdmin` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc](std::sync::Arc) to reuse it, because it
/// already uses an `Arc` internally.
