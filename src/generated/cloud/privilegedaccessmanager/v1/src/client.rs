/// Implements a client for the Privileged Access Manager API.
///
/// # Service Description
///
/// This API allows customers to manage temporary, request based privileged
/// access to their resources.
///
/// It defines the following resource model:
///
/// * A collection of `Entitlement` resources. An entitlement allows configuring
///   (among other things):
///
///   * Some kind of privileged access that users can request.
///   * A set of users called _requesters_ who can request this access.
///   * A maximum duration for which the access can be requested.
///   * An optional approval workflow which must be satisfied before access is
///     granted.
/// * A collection of `Grant` resources. A grant is a request by a requester to
///   get the privileged access specified in an entitlement for some duration.
///
/// * After the approval workflow as specified in the entitlement is satisfied,
///   the specified access is given to the requester. The access is automatically
///   taken back after the requested duration is over.
///
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// `PrivilegedAccessManager` has various configuration parameters, the defaults should
/// work with most applications.
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `PrivilegedAccessManager` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `PrivilegedAccessManager` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
