//! Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Vertex AI API
//!
//! **WARNING:** this crate is under active development. We expect multiple
//! breaking changes in the upcoming releases. Testing is also incomplete, we do
//! **not** recommend that you use this crate in production. We welcome feedback
//! about the APIs, documentation, missing features, bugs, etc.
//!
//! This crate contains traits, types, and functions to interact with Vertex AI API
//! Most applications will use the structs defined in the [client] module.
//! More specifically:
//!
