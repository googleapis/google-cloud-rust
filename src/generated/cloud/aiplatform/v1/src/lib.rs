//! Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Vertex AI API
//!
//! **WARNING:** some RPCs have no corresponding Rust function to call them.
//! Typically these are streaming RPCs. We expect adding these RPCs in a
//! way that does not break the existing APIs or changes their behavior in a
//! significant way. We do anticipate a number of new crate dependencies
//! will be required. If you need these RPCs please open an issue in our
//! GitHub repository.
//!
//! This crate contains traits, types, and functions to interact with Vertex AI API
//! Most applications will use the structs defined in the [client] module.
//!
//! The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
//! Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client
//! libraries are designed to preserve backwards compatibility when the service
//! changes in compatible ways. For example, adding RPCs, or fields to messages
//! should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.
//!

//! # Features
//!
//! - `default-rustls-provider`: enabled by default. Use the default rustls
//!   crypto provider ([aws-lc-rs]) for TLS and authentication. Applications
//!   with specific requirements for cryptography (such as exclusively using the
//!   [ring] crate) should disable this default and call
//!   `rustls::crypto::CryptoProvider::install_default()`.
//! - Each client can be enabled using its own feature. Use the client's name
//!   in `kebab-case` to enable the client.
//!
