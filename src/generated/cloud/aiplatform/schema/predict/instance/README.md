# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Vertex AI API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

Train high-quality custom machine learning models with minimal machine
learning expertise and effort.

The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client
libraries are designed to preserve backwards compatibility when the service
changes in compatible ways. For example, adding RPCs, or fields to messages
should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.
