# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - NetApp API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**FEEDBACK WANTED:** We believe the APIs in this crate are stable, and
do not anticipate any breaking changes are needed. We are looking for
feedback before labeling the APIs "1.0". Changes (even breaking changes)
are still possible, but not expected.

We also believe the implementation is ready for production, bugs are
still possible, but not expected.

Google Cloud NetApp Volumes is a fully-managed, cloud-based data storage
service that provides advanced data management capabilities and highly
scalable performance with global availability.
