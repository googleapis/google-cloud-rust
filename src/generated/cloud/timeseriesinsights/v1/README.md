# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Timeseries Insights API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**FEEDBACK WANTED:** We believe the APIs in this crate are stable, and
do not anticipate any breaking changes are needed. We are looking for
feedback before labeling the APIs "1.0". Changes (even breaking changes)
are still possible, but not expected.

We also believe the implementation is ready for production, bugs are
still possible, but not expected.

Provides a Timeseries Insights service which operates over time series
data. Users can perform time series spike, trend, and anomaly detection.
With a straightforward API and easy to understand results, the service
makes it simple to gather insights from large amounts of time series data
(e.g. monitoring datasets) and integrate these insights in their
applications.
