//! Traits to mock the clients in this library.
//!
//! Application developers may need to mock the clients in this library to test
//! how their application works with different (and sometimes hard to trigger)
//! client and service behavior. Such test can define mocks implementing the
//! trait(s) defined in this module, initialize the client with an instance of
//! this mock in their tests, and verify their application responds as expected.
