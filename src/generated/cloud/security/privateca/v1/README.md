# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Certificate Authority API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

The Certificate Authority Service API is a highly-available, scalable
service that enables you to simplify and automate the management of
private certificate authorities (CAs) while staying in control of your
private keys.

The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client
libraries are designed to preserve backwards compatibility when the service
changes in compatible ways. For example, adding RPCs, or fields to messages
should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.

## Quickstart

The main types to work with this crate are the clients:

- [CertificateAuthorityService]
