# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Certificate Authority API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**FEEDBACK WANTED:** We believe the APIs in this crate are stable, and
do not anticipate any breaking changes are needed. We are looking for
feedback before labeling the APIs "1.0". Changes (even breaking changes)
are still possible, but not expected.

We also believe the implementation is ready for production, bugs are
still possible, but not expected.

The Certificate Authority Service API is a highly-available, scalable
service that enables you to simplify and automate the management of
private certificate authorities (CAs) while staying in control of your
private keys.

## Quickstart

The main types to work with this crate are the clients:

- [CertificateAuthorityService]
