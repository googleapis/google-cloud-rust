# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Public Certificate Authority API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**FEEDBACK WANTED:** We believe the APIs in this crate are stable, and
do not anticipate any breaking changes are needed. We are looking for
feedback before labeling the APIs "1.0". Changes (even breaking changes)
are still possible, but not expected.

We also believe the implementation is ready for production, bugs are
still possible, but not expected.

The Public Certificate Authority API may be used to create and manage ACME
external account binding keys associated with Google Trust Services'
publicly trusted certificate authority.

## Quickstart

The main types to work with this crate are the clients:

- [PublicCertificateAuthorityService]
