//! Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Storage Batch Operations API
//!
//! **FEEDBACK WANTED:** We believe the APIs in this crate are stable, and
//! do not anticipate any breaking changes are needed. We are looking for
//! feedback before labeling the APIs "1.0". Changes (even breaking changes)
//! are still possible, but not expected.
//!
//! We also believe the implementation is ready for production, bugs are
//! still possible, but not expected.
//!
//!
//! This crate contains traits, types, and functions to interact with Storage Batch Operations API
//! Most applications will use the structs defined in the [client] module.
//! More specifically:
//!
//! * [StorageBatchOperations](client/struct.StorageBatchOperations.html)
