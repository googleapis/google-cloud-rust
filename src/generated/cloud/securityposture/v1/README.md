# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Security Posture API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

Security Posture is a comprehensive framework of policy sets that empowers organizations to define, assess early, deploy, and monitor their security measures in a unified way and helps simplify governance and reduces administrative toil.

The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client
libraries are designed to preserve backwards compatibility when the service
changes in compatible ways. For example, adding RPCs, or fields to messages
should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.
