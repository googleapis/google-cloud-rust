/// Implements a client for the Security Posture API.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// # tokio_test::block_on(async {
/// # use google_cloud_securityposture_v1::client::SecurityPosture;
/// let client = SecurityPosture::builder().build().await?;
/// // use `client` to make requests to the Security Posture API.
/// # gax::client_builder::Result::<()>::Ok(()) });
/// ```
///
/// # Service Description
///
/// Service describing handlers for resources.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// To configure `SecurityPosture` use the `with_*` methods in the type returned
/// by [builder()][SecurityPosture::builder]. The default configuration should
/// work for most applications. Common configuration changes include
///
/// * [with_endpoint()]: by default this client uses the global default endpoint
///   (`https://securityposture.googleapis.com`). Applications using regional
///   endpoints or running in restricted networks (e.g. a network configured
//    with [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]) may want to
///   override this default.
/// * [with_credentials()]: by default this client uses
///   [Application Default Credentials]. Applications using custom
///   authentication may need to override this default.
///
/// [with_endpoint()]: super::builder::security_posture::ClientBuilder::with_endpoint
/// [with_credentials()]: super::builder::security_posture::ClientBuilder::credentials
/// [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]: https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/private-connectivity
/// [Application Default Credentials]: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#adc
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `SecurityPosture` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `SecurityPosture` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc](std::sync::Arc) to reuse it, because it
/// already uses an `Arc` internally.
