///
/// # Service Description
///
/// The Reachability service in the Google Cloud Network Management API provides
/// services that analyze the reachability within a single Google Virtual Private
/// Cloud (VPC) network, between peered VPC networks, between VPC and on-premises
/// networks, or between VPC networks and internet hosts. A reachability analysis
/// is based on Google Cloud network configurations.
///
/// You can use the analysis results to verify these configurations and
/// to troubleshoot connectivity issues.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// To configure `ReachabilityService` use the `with_*` methods in the type returned
/// by [builder()][ReachabilityService::builder]. The default configuration should
/// work for most applications. Common configuration changes include
///
/// * [with_endpoint()]: by default this client uses the global default endpoint
///   (`https://networkmanagement.googleapis.com`). Applications using regional
///   endpoints or running in restricted networks (e.g. a network configured
//    with [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]) may want to
///   override this default.
/// * [with_credentials()]: by default this client uses
///   [Application Default Credentials]. Applications using custom
///   authentication may need to override this default.
///
/// [with_endpoint()]: super::builder::reachability_service::ClientBuilder::with_endpoint
/// [with_credentials()]: super::builder::reachability_service::ClientBuilder::credentials
/// [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]: https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/private-connectivity
/// [Application Default Credentials]: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#adc
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `ReachabilityService` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `ReachabilityService` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
