/// # Service Description
///
/// EdgeNetwork API provides managed, highly available cloud dynamic network
/// configuration service to the GEC customer to enable edge application and
/// network function solutions. This allows the customers to easily define and
/// configure the network setup and property to meet the workload requirement.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// `EdgeNetwork` has various configuration parameters, the defaults should
/// work with most applications.
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `EdgeNetwork` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `EdgeNetwork` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
