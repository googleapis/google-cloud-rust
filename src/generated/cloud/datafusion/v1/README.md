# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Cloud Data Fusion API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**FEEDBACK WANTED:** We believe the APIs in this crate are stable, and
do not anticipate any breaking changes are needed. We are looking for
feedback before labeling the APIs "1.0". Changes (even breaking changes)
are still possible, but not expected.

We also believe the implementation is ready for production, bugs are
still possible, but not expected.

Cloud Data Fusion is a fully-managed, cloud native, enterprise data
integration service for     quickly building and managing data pipelines.
It provides a graphical interface to increase     time efficiency and
reduce complexity, and allows business users, developers, and data
scientists to easily and reliably build scalable data integration
solutions to cleanse,     prepare, blend, transfer and transform data
without having to wrestle with infrastructure.
