/// # Configuration
///
/// `CloudDeploy` has various configuration parameters, the defaults should
/// work with most applications.
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `CloudDeploy` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `CloudDeploy` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
