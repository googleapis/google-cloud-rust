/// Implements a client for the BeyondCorp API.
///
/// # Service Description
///
/// API Overview:
///
/// The `beyondcorp.googleapis.com` service implements the Google Cloud
/// BeyondCorp API.
///
/// Data Model:
///
/// The AppConnectionsService exposes the following resources:
///
/// * AppConnections, named as follows:
///   `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/appConnections/{app_connection_id}`.
///
/// The AppConnectionsService service provides methods to manage
/// (create/read/update/delete) BeyondCorp AppConnections.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// `AppConnectionsService` has various configuration parameters, the defaults should
/// work with most applications.
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `AppConnectionsService` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `AppConnectionsService` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
