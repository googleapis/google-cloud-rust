/// Implements a client for the Cloud Optimization API.

/// # Service Description
///
/// A service for optimizing vehicle tours.
///
/// Validity of certain types of fields:
///
/// * `google.protobuf.Timestamp`
///   * Times are in Unix time: seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00.
///   * seconds must be in [0, 253402300799],
///     i.e. in [1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00, 9999-12-31T23:59:59+00:00].
///   * nanos must be unset or set to 0.
/// * `google.protobuf.Duration`
///   * seconds must be in [0, 253402300799],
///     i.e. in [1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00, 9999-12-31T23:59:59+00:00].
///   * nanos must be unset or set to 0.
/// * `google.type.LatLng`
///   * latitude must be in [-90.0, 90.0].
///   * longitude must be in [-180.0, 180.0].
///   * at least one of latitude and longitude must be non-zero.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// `FleetRouting` has various configuration parameters, the defaults should
/// work with most applications.

/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `FleetRouting` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `FleetRouting` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
