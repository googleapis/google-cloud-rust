# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Cloud Optimization API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**FEEDBACK WANTED:** We believe the APIs in this crate are stable, and
do not anticipate any breaking changes are needed. We are looking for
feedback before labeling the APIs "1.0". Changes (even breaking changes)
are still possible, but not expected.

We also believe the implementation is ready for production, bugs are
still possible, but not expected.

Cloud Optimization API provides a portfolio of solvers to address common
optimization use cases starting with optimal route planning for vehicle
fleets.
