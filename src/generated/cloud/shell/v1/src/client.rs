/// Implements a client for the Cloud Shell API.
///
/// # Service Description
///
/// API for interacting with Google Cloud Shell. Each user of Cloud Shell has at
/// least one environment, which has the ID "default". Environment consists of a
/// Docker image defining what is installed on the environment and a home
/// directory containing the user's data that will remain across sessions.
/// Clients use this API to start and fetch information about their environment,
/// which can then be used to connect to that environment via a separate SSH
/// client.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// `CloudShellService` has various configuration parameters, the defaults should
/// work with most applications.
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `CloudShellService` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `CloudShellService` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
