/// Implements a client for the Secure Source Manager API.
///
/// # Service Description
///
/// Secure Source Manager API
///
/// Access Secure Source Manager instances, resources, and repositories.
///
/// This API is split across two servers: the Control Plane and the Data Plane.
///
/// Data Plane endpoints are hosted directly by your Secure Source Manager
/// instance, so you must connect to your instance's API hostname to access
/// them. The API hostname looks like the following:
///
/// https://[instance-id]-[project-number]-api.[location].sourcemanager.dev
///
/// For example,
///
/// <https://my-instance-702770452863-api.us-central1.sourcemanager.dev>
///
/// Data Plane endpoints are denoted with **Host: Data Plane**.
///
/// All other endpoints are found in the normal Cloud API location, namely,
/// `securcesourcemanager.googleapis.com`.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// `SecureSourceManager` has various configuration parameters, the defaults should
/// work with most applications.
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `SecureSourceManager` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `SecureSourceManager` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
