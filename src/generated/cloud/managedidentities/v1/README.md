# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**FEEDBACK WANTED:** We believe the APIs in this crate are stable, and
do not anticipate any breaking changes are needed. We are looking for
feedback before labeling the APIs "1.0". Changes (even breaking changes)
are still possible, but not expected.

We also believe the implementation is ready for production, bugs are
still possible, but not expected.

The Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory API is used for managing
a highly available, hardened service running Microsoft Active Directory
(AD).
