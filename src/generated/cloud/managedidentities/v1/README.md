# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

The Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory API is used for managing
a highly available, hardened service running Microsoft Active Directory
(AD).

The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client
libraries are designed to preserve backwards compatibility when the service
changes in compatible ways. For example, adding RPCs, or fields to messages
should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.

## Quickstart

The main types to work with this crate are the clients:

- [ManagedIdentitiesService]

## Features

- `default-rustls-provider`: enabled by default. Use the default rustls crypto
  provider ([ring]) for TLS and authentication. Applications with specific
  requirements for cryptography (such as exclusively using the [aws-lc-rs])
  should disable this default and call
  `rustls::CryptoProvider::install_default()`.
