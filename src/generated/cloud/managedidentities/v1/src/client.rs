/// Implements a client for the Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory API.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// # tokio_test::block_on(async {
/// # use google_cloud_managedidentities_v1::client::ManagedIdentitiesService;
/// let client = ManagedIdentitiesService::builder().build().await?;
/// // use `client` to make requests to the Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory API.
/// # gax::client_builder::Result::<()>::Ok(()) });
/// ```
///
/// # Service Description
///
/// API Overview
///
/// The `managedidentites.googleapis.com` service implements the Google Cloud
/// Managed Identites API for identity services
/// (e.g. Microsoft Active Directory).
///
/// The Managed Identities service provides methods to manage
/// (create/read/update/delete) domains, reset managed identities admin password,
/// add/remove domain controllers in GCP regions and add/remove VPC peering.
///
/// Data Model
///
/// The Managed Identities service exposes the following resources:
///
/// * Locations as global, named as follows:
///   `projects/{project_id}/locations/global`.
///
/// * Domains, named as follows:
///   `/projects/{project_id}/locations/global/domain/{domain_name}`.
///
///
/// The `{domain_name}` refers to fully qualified domain name in the customer
/// project e.g. mydomain.myorganization.com, with the following restrictions:
///
/// * Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, periods and hyphens.
/// * Must start with a letter.
/// * Must contain between 2-64 characters.
/// * Must end with a number or a letter.
/// * Must not start with period.
/// * First segement length (mydomain form example above) shouldn't exceed
///   15 chars.
/// * The last segment cannot be fully numeric.
/// * Must be unique within the customer project.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// To configure `ManagedIdentitiesService` use the `with_*` methods in the type returned
/// by [builder()][ManagedIdentitiesService::builder]. The default configuration should
/// work for most applications. Common configuration changes include
///
/// * [with_endpoint()]: by default this client uses the global default endpoint
///   (`https://managedidentities.googleapis.com`). Applications using regional
///   endpoints or running in restricted networks (e.g. a network configured
//    with [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]) may want to
///   override this default.
/// * [with_credentials()]: by default this client uses
///   [Application Default Credentials]. Applications using custom
///   authentication may need to override this default.
///
/// [with_endpoint()]: super::builder::managed_identities_service::ClientBuilder::with_endpoint
/// [with_credentials()]: super::builder::managed_identities_service::ClientBuilder::credentials
/// [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]: https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/private-connectivity
/// [Application Default Credentials]: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#adc
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `ManagedIdentitiesService` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `ManagedIdentitiesService` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc](std::sync::Arc) to reuse it, because it
/// already uses an `Arc` internally.
