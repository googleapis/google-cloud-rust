/// Implements a client for the Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory API.
///
/// # Service Description
///
/// API Overview
///
/// The `managedidentites.googleapis.com` service implements the Google Cloud
/// Managed Identites API for identity services
/// (e.g. Microsoft Active Directory).
///
/// The Managed Identities service provides methods to manage
/// (create/read/update/delete) domains, reset managed identities admin password,
/// add/remove domain controllers in GCP regions and add/remove VPC peering.
///
/// Data Model
///
/// The Managed Identities service exposes the following resources:
///
/// * Locations as global, named as follows:
///   `projects/{project_id}/locations/global`.
///
/// * Domains, named as follows:
///   `/projects/{project_id}/locations/global/domain/{domain_name}`.
///
///
/// The `{domain_name}` refers to fully qualified domain name in the customer
/// project e.g. mydomain.myorganization.com, with the following restrictions:
///
/// * Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, periods and hyphens.
/// * Must start with a letter.
/// * Must contain between 2-64 characters.
/// * Must end with a number or a letter.
/// * Must not start with period.
/// * First segement length (mydomain form example above) shouldn't exceed
///   15 chars.
/// * The last segment cannot be fully numeric.
/// * Must be unique within the customer project.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// `ManagedIdentitiesService` has various configuration parameters, the defaults should
/// work with most applications.
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `ManagedIdentitiesService` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `ManagedIdentitiesService` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
