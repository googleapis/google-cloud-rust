/// # Service Description
///
/// Using Live Stream API, you can generate live streams in the various
/// renditions and streaming formats. The streaming format include HTTP Live
/// Streaming (HLS) and Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH). You can send
/// a source stream in the various ways, including Real-Time Messaging
/// Protocol (RTMP) and Secure Reliable Transport (SRT).
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// `LivestreamService` has various configuration parameters, the defaults should
/// work with most applications.
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `LivestreamService` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `LivestreamService` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
