//! Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Dialogflow API
//!
//! **WARNING:** this crate is under active development. We expect multiple
//! breaking changes in the upcoming releases. Testing is also incomplete, we do
//! **not** recommend that you use this crate in production. We welcome feedback

//!
//! This crate contains traits, types, and functions to interact with Dialogflow API
//! Most applications will use the structs defined in the [client] module.
//! More specifically:
//!
//! * [Agents](client/struct.Agents.html)
//! * [Changelogs](client/struct.Changelogs.html)
//! * [Deployments](client/struct.Deployments.html)
