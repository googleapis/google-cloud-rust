# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Maintenance API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

The Maintenance API provides a centralized view of planned disruptive
maintenance events across supported Google Cloud products. It offers users
visibility into upcoming, ongoing, and completed maintenance, along with
controls to manage certain maintenance activities, such as mainteance
windows, rescheduling, and on-demand updates.

The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client
libraries are designed to preserve backwards compatibility when the service
changes in compatible ways. For example, adding RPCs, or fields to messages
should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.

## Quickstart
