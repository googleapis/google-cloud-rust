# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Google Compute Engine API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->


Creates and runs virtual machines on Google Cloud Platform. 

The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client
libraries are designed to preserve backwards compatibility when the service

should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.

## Quickstart
