# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Organization Policy API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**FEEDBACK WANTED:** We believe the APIs in this crate are stable, and
do not anticipate any breaking changes are needed. We are looking for
feedback before labeling the APIs "1.0". Changes (even breaking changes)
are still possible, but not expected.

We also believe the implementation is ready for production, bugs are
still possible, but not expected.

The Organization Policy API allows users to configure governance rules on
their Google Cloud resources across the resource hierarchy.

## Quickstart

The main types to work with this crate are the clients:
