# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Cloud Natural Language API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->


Provides natural language understanding technologies, such as sentiment
analysis, entity recognition, entity sentiment analysis, and other text
annotations, to developers.

The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client
libraries are designed to preserve backwards compatibility when the service
changes in compatible ways. For example, adding RPCs, or fields to messages
should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.

## Quickstart
