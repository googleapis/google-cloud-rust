# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Cloud IDS API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

Cloud IDS (Cloud Intrusion Detection System) detects malware, spyware,
command-and-control attacks, and other network-based threats. Its security
efficacy is industry leading, built with Palo Alto Networks technologies.
When you use this product, your organization name and consumption levels
will be shared with Palo Alto Networks.

The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client
libraries are designed to preserve backwards compatibility when the service
changes in compatible ways. For example, adding RPCs, or fields to messages
should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.
