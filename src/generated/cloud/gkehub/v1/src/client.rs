/// Implements a client for the GKE Hub.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// # async fn sample() -> google_cloud_gax::client_builder::Result<()> {
/// # use google_cloud_gkehub_v1::client::GkeHub;
/// let client = GkeHub::builder().build().await?;
/// // use `client` to make requests to the GKE Hub.
/// # Ok(()) }
/// ```
///
/// # Service Description
///
/// The GKE Hub service handles the registration of many Kubernetes clusters to
/// Google Cloud, and the management of multi-cluster features over those
/// clusters.
///
/// The GKE Hub service operates on the following resources:
///
/// * [Membership][google.cloud.gkehub.v1.Membership]
/// * [Feature][google.cloud.gkehub.v1.Feature]
///
/// GKE Hub is currently available in the global region and all regions in
/// <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones>. Feature is only
/// available in global region while membership is global region and all the
/// regions.
///
/// **Membership management may be non-trivial:** it is recommended to use one
/// of the Google-provided client libraries or tools where possible when working
/// with Membership resources.
///
/// [google.cloud.gkehub.v1.Feature]: crate::model::Feature
/// [google.cloud.gkehub.v1.Membership]: crate::model::Membership
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// To configure `GkeHub` use the `with_*` methods in the type returned
/// by [builder()][GkeHub::builder]. The default configuration should
/// work for most applications. Common configuration changes include
///
/// * [with_endpoint()]: by default this client uses the global default endpoint
///   (`https://gkehub.googleapis.com`). Applications using regional
///   endpoints or running in restricted networks (e.g. a network configured
//    with [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]) may want to
///   override this default.
/// * [with_credentials()]: by default this client uses
///   [Application Default Credentials]. Applications using custom
///   authentication may need to override this default.
///
/// [with_endpoint()]: super::builder::gke_hub::ClientBuilder::with_endpoint
/// [with_credentials()]: super::builder::gke_hub::ClientBuilder::credentials
/// [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]: https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/private-connectivity
/// [Application Default Credentials]: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#adc
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `GkeHub` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `GkeHub` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc](std::sync::Arc) to reuse it, because it
/// already uses an `Arc` internally.
