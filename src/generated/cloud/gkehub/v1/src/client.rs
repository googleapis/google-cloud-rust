/// Implements a client for the GKE Hub.
///
/// # Service Description
///
/// The GKE Hub service handles the registration of many Kubernetes clusters to
/// Google Cloud, and the management of multi-cluster features over those
/// clusters.
///
/// The GKE Hub service operates on the following resources:
///
/// * [Membership][google.cloud.gkehub.v1.Membership]
/// * [Feature][google.cloud.gkehub.v1.Feature]
///
/// GKE Hub is currently available in the global region and all regions in
/// <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones>. Feature is only
/// available in global region while membership is global region and all the
/// regions.
///
/// **Membership management may be non-trivial:** it is recommended to use one
/// of the Google-provided client libraries or tools where possible when working
/// with Membership resources.
///
/// [google.cloud.gkehub.v1.Feature]: crate::model::Feature
/// [google.cloud.gkehub.v1.Membership]: crate::model::Membership
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// `GkeHub` has various configuration parameters, the defaults should
/// work with most applications.
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `GkeHub` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `GkeHub` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
