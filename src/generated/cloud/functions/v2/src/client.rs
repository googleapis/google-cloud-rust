/// Implements a client for the Cloud Functions API.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// # tokio_test::block_on(async {
/// # use google_cloud_functions_v2::client::FunctionService;
/// let client = FunctionService::builder().build().await?;
/// // use `client` to make requests to the Cloud Functions API.
/// # gax::client_builder::Result::<()>::Ok(()) });
/// ```
///
/// # Service Description
///
/// Google Cloud Functions is used to deploy functions that are executed by
/// Google in response to various events. Data connected with that event is
/// passed to a function as the input data.
///
/// A **function** is a resource which describes a function that should be
/// executed and how it is triggered.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// To configure `FunctionService` use the `with_*` methods in the type returned
/// by [builder()][FunctionService::builder]. The default configuration should
/// work for most applications. Common configuration changes include
///
/// * [with_endpoint()]: by default this client uses the global default endpoint
///   (`https://cloudfunctions.googleapis.com`). Applications using regional
///   endpoints or running in restricted networks (e.g. a network configured
//    with [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]) may want to
///   override this default.
/// * [with_credentials()]: by default this client uses
///   [Application Default Credentials]. Applications using custom
///   authentication may need to override this default.
///
/// [with_endpoint()]: super::builder::function_service::ClientBuilder::with_endpoint
/// [with_credentials()]: super::builder::function_service::ClientBuilder::credentials
/// [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]: https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/private-connectivity
/// [Application Default Credentials]: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#adc
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `FunctionService` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `FunctionService` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc](std::sync::Arc) to reuse it, because it
/// already uses an `Arc` internally.
