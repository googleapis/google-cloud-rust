/// Implements a client for the BigQuery Reservation API.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// # tokio_test::block_on(async {
/// # use google_cloud_bigquery_reservation_v1::client::ReservationService;
/// let client = ReservationService::builder().build().await?;
/// // use `client` to make requests to the BigQuery Reservation API.
/// # gax::Result::<()>::Ok(()) });
/// ```
///
/// # Service Description
///
/// This API allows users to manage their BigQuery reservations.
///
/// A reservation provides computational resource guarantees, in the form of
/// [slots](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/slots), to users. A slot is a
/// unit of computational power in BigQuery, and serves as the basic unit of
/// parallelism. In a scan of a multi-partitioned table, a single slot operates
/// on a single partition of the table. A reservation resource exists as a child
/// resource of the admin project and location, e.g.:
/// `projects/myproject/locations/US/reservations/reservationName`.
///
/// A capacity commitment is a way to purchase compute capacity for BigQuery jobs
/// (in the form of slots) with some committed period of usage. A capacity
/// commitment resource exists as a child resource of the admin project and
/// location, e.g.:
/// `projects/myproject/locations/US/capacityCommitments/id`.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// To configure `ReservationService` use the `with_*` methods in the type returned
/// by [builder()][ReservationService::builder]. The default configuration should
/// work for most applications. Common configuration changes include
///
/// * [with_endpoint()]: by default this client uses the global default endpoint
///   (`https://bigqueryreservation.googleapis.com`). Applications using regional
///   endpoints or running in restricted networks (e.g. a network configured
//    with [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]) may want to
///   override this default.
/// * [with_credentials()]: by default this client uses
///   [Application Default Credentials]. Applications using custom
///   authentication may need to override this default.
///
/// [with_endpoint()]: super::builder::reservation_service::ClientBuilder::with_endpoint
/// [with_credentials()]: super::builder::reservation_service::ClientBuilder::credentials
/// [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]: https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/private-connectivity
/// [Application Default Credentials]: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#adc
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `ReservationService` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `ReservationService` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
