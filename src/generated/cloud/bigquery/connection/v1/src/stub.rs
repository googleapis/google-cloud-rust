//! Traits to mock the clients in this library.
//!
//! Application developers may need to mock the clients in this library to test
//! how their application works with different (and sometimes hard to trigger)
//! client and service behavior. Such test can define mocks implementing the
//! trait(s) defined in this module, initialize the client with an instance of
//! this mock in their tests, and verify their application responds as expected.

/// Services gain new RPCs routinely. Consequently, this trait gains new methods
/// too. To avoid breaking applications the trait provides a default
/// implementation of each method. Most of these implementations just return an
