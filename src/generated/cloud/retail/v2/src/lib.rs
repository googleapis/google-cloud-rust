//! Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Vertex AI Search for commerce API
//!
//!
//!
//! **WARNING:** some RPCs have no corresponding Rust function to call them.
//! Typically these are streaming RPCs. We expect adding these RPCs in a
//! way that does not break the existing APIs or changes their behavior in a
//! significant way. We do anticipate a number of new crate dependencies
//! will be required. If you need these RPCs please open an issue in our
//! GitHub repository.
//!
//!
//! This crate contains traits, types, and functions to interact with Vertex AI Search for commerce API
//! Most applications will use the structs defined in the [client] module.
//!
//!
//! The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
//! Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client
//! libraries are designed to preserve backwards compatibility when the service
//! changes in compatible ways. For example, adding RPCs, or fields to messages
//! should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.
//!
