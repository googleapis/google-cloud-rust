# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Vertex AI Search for commerce API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**WARNING:** some RPCs have no corresponding Rust function to call them.
Typically these are streaming RPCs. We expect adding these RPCs in a
way that does not break the existing APIs or changes their behavior in a
significant way. We do anticipate a number of new crate dependencies
will be required. If you need these RPCs please open an issue in our
GitHub repository.

Vertex AI Search for commerce API is made up of Retail Search, Browse and
Recommendations. These discovery AI solutions help you implement
personalized search, browse and recommendations, based on machine learning
models, across your websites and mobile applications.

The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client
libraries are designed to preserve backwards compatibility when the service
changes in compatible ways. For example, adding RPCs, or fields to messages
should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.

## Quickstart

The main types to work with this crate are the clients:

- [AnalyticsService]
- [CatalogService]
- [CompletionService]
- [ControlService]
- [ConversationalSearchService]
- [GenerativeQuestionService]
- [ModelService]
- [PredictionService]
- [ProductService]
- [SearchService]
- [ServingConfigService]
- [UserEventService]

## Features

- `default-rustls-provider`: enabled by default. Use the default rustls crypto
  provider ([aws-lc-rs]) for TLS and authentication. Applications with specific
  requirements for cryptography (such as exclusively using the [ring] crate)
  should disable this default and call
  `rustls::crypto::CryptoProvider::install_default()`.
