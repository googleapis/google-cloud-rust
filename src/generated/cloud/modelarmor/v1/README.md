# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Model Armor API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**FEEDBACK WANTED:** We believe the APIs in this crate are stable, and
do not anticipate any breaking changes are needed. We are looking for
feedback before labeling the APIs "1.0". Changes (even breaking changes)
are still possible, but not expected.

We also believe the implementation is ready for production, bugs are
still possible, but not expected.

Model Armor helps you protect against risks like prompt injection, harmful
content, and data leakage in generative AI applications by letting you
define policies that filter user prompts and model responses.
