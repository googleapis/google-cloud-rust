# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - GKE Multi-Cloud API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

GKE Multi-Cloud provides a way to manage Kubernetes clusters that run on
AWS and Azure infrastructure using the GKE Multi-Cloud API.  Combined with
Connect, you can manage Kubernetes clusters on Google Cloud, AWS, and
Azure from the Google Cloud Console.

When you create a cluster with GKE Multi-Cloud, Google creates the
resources needed and brings up a cluster on your behalf.  You can deploy
workloads with the GKE Multi-Cloud API or the gcloud and kubectl
command-line tools.

The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client
libraries are designed to preserve backwards compatibility when the service
changes in compatible ways. For example, adding RPCs, or fields to messages
should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.

## Quickstart

The main types to work with this crate are the clients:

- [AttachedClusters]
- [AwsClusters]
- [AzureClusters]

## Features

- `default-rustls-provider`: enabled by default. Use the default rustls crypto
  provider ([aws-lc-rs]) for TLS and authentication. Applications with specific
  requirements for cryptography (such as exclusively using the [ring] crate)
  should disable this default and call
  `rustls::crypto::CryptoProvider::install_default()`.
