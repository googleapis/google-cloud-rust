# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - GKE Multi-Cloud API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**FEEDBACK WANTED:** We believe the APIs in this crate are stable, and
do not anticipate any breaking changes are needed. We are looking for
feedback before labeling the APIs "1.0". Changes (even breaking changes)
are still possible, but not expected.

We also believe the implementation is ready for production, bugs are
still possible, but not expected.

GKE Multi-Cloud provides a way to manage Kubernetes clusters that run on
AWS and Azure infrastructure using the GKE Multi-Cloud API.  Combined with
Connect, you can manage Kubernetes clusters on Google Cloud, AWS, and
Azure from the Google Cloud Console.

When you create a cluster with GKE Multi-Cloud, Google creates the
resources needed and brings up a cluster on your behalf.  You can deploy
workloads with the GKE Multi-Cloud API or the gcloud and kubectl
command-line tools.
