# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - AlloyDB API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**FEEDBACK WANTED:** We believe the APIs in this crate are stable, and
do not anticipate any breaking changes are needed. We are looking for
feedback before labeling the APIs "1.0". Changes (even breaking changes)
are still possible, but not expected.

We also believe the implementation is ready for production, bugs are
still possible, but not expected.

AlloyDB for PostgreSQL is an open source-compatible database service that
provides a powerful option for migrating, modernizing, or building
commercial-grade applications. It offers full compatibility with standard
PostgreSQL, and is more than 4x faster for transactional workloads and up
to 100x faster for analytical queries than standard PostgreSQL in our
performance tests. AlloyDB for PostgreSQL offers a 99.99 percent
availability SLA inclusive of maintenance. <br><br> AlloyDB is optimized
for the most demanding use cases, allowing you to build new applications
that require high transaction throughput, large database sizes, or
multiple read resources; scale existing PostgreSQL workloads with no
application changes; and modernize legacy proprietary databases.
