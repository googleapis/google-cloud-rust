/// Implements a client for the Eventarc Publishing API.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// # async fn sample() -> gax::client_builder::Result<()> {
/// # use google_cloud_eventarc_publishing_v1::client::Publisher;
/// let client = Publisher::builder().build().await?;
/// // use `client` to make requests to the Eventarc Publishing API.
/// # Ok(()) }
/// ```
///
/// # Service Description
///
/// Eventarc processes events generated by an event provider and delivers them to
/// a subscriber.
///
/// An event provider is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) system or
/// product that can generate and deliver events through Eventarc.
///
/// A third-party event provider is an event provider from outside of Google.
///
/// A partner is a third-party event provider that is integrated with Eventarc.
///
/// A subscriber is a Google Cloud customer interested in receiving events.
///
/// Channel is a first-class Eventarc resource that is created and managed
/// by the subscriber in their Google Cloud project. A Channel represents a
/// subscriber's intent to receive events from an event provider. A Channel is
/// associated with exactly one event provider.
///
/// ChannelConnection is a first-class Eventarc resource that
/// is created and managed by the partner in their Google Cloud project. A
/// ChannelConnection represents a connection between a partner and a
/// subscriber's Channel. A ChannelConnection has a one-to-one mapping with a
/// Channel.
///
/// Bus is a first-class Eventarc resource that is created and managed in a
/// Google Cloud project. A Bus provides a discoverable endpoint for events and
/// is a router that receives all events published by event providers and
/// delivers them to zero or more subscribers.
///
/// Publisher allows an event provider to publish events to Eventarc.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// To configure `Publisher` use the `with_*` methods in the type returned
/// by [builder()][Publisher::builder]. The default configuration should
/// work for most applications. Common configuration changes include
///
/// * [with_endpoint()]: by default this client uses the global default endpoint
///   (`https://eventarcpublishing.googleapis.com`). Applications using regional
///   endpoints or running in restricted networks (e.g. a network configured
//    with [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]) may want to
///   override this default.
/// * [with_credentials()]: by default this client uses
///   [Application Default Credentials]. Applications using custom
///   authentication may need to override this default.
///
/// [with_endpoint()]: super::builder::publisher::ClientBuilder::with_endpoint
/// [with_credentials()]: super::builder::publisher::ClientBuilder::credentials
/// [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]: https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/private-connectivity
/// [Application Default Credentials]: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#adc
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `Publisher` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `Publisher` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc](std::sync::Arc) to reuse it, because it
/// already uses an `Arc` internally.
