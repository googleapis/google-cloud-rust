# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Binary Authorization API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

The management interface for Binary Authorization, a system providing
policy control for images deployed to Kubernetes Engine clusters, Anthos
clusters on VMware, and Cloud Run.

The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client
libraries are designed to preserve backwards compatibility when the service
changes in compatible ways. For example, adding RPCs, or fields to messages
should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.

## Quickstart

The main types to work with this crate are the clients:

- [BinauthzManagementServiceV1]
- [SystemPolicyV1]
- [ValidationHelperV1]

## Features

- `default-rustls-provider`: enabled by default. Use the default rustls crypto
  provider ([aws-lc-rs]) for TLS and authentication. Applications with specific
  requirements for cryptography (such as exclusively using the [ring] crate)
  should disable this default and call
  `rustls::crypto::CryptoProvider::install_default()`.
