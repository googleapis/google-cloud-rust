# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Binary Authorization API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**FEEDBACK WANTED:** We believe the APIs in this crate are stable, and
do not anticipate any breaking changes are needed. We are looking for
feedback before labeling the APIs "1.0". Changes (even breaking changes)
are still possible, but not expected.

We also believe the implementation is ready for production, bugs are
still possible, but not expected.

The management interface for Binary Authorization, a system providing
policy control for images deployed to Kubernetes Engine clusters, Anthos
clusters on VMware, and Cloud Run.
