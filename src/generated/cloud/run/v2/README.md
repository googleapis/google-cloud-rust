# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Cloud Run Admin API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**FEEDBACK WANTED:** We believe the APIs in this crate are stable, and
do not anticipate any breaking changes are needed. We are looking for
feedback before labeling the APIs "1.0". Changes (even breaking changes)
are still possible, but not expected.

We also believe the implementation is ready for production, bugs are
still possible, but not expected.

Deploy and manage user provided container images that scale automatically
based on incoming requests. The Cloud Run Admin API v1 follows the Knative
Serving API specification, while v2 is aligned with Google Cloud AIP-based
API standards, as described in https://google.aip.dev/.
