/// # Service Description
///
/// Lineage is used to track data flows between assets over time. You can
/// create [LineageEvents][google.cloud.datacatalog.lineage.v1.LineageEvent]
/// to record lineage between multiple sources and a single target, for
/// example, when table data is based on data from multiple tables.
///
/// [google.cloud.datacatalog.lineage.v1.LineageEvent]: crate::model::LineageEvent
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// `Lineage` has various configuration parameters, the defaults should
/// work with most applications.
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `Lineage` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `Lineage` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
