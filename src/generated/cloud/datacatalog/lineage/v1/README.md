# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Data Lineage API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client

changes in compatible ways. For example, adding RPCs, or fields to messages
should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.
