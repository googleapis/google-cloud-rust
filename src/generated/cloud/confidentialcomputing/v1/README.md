# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Confidential Computing API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

Attestation verifier for Confidential Space.

The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client
libraries are designed to preserve backwards compatibility when the service
changes in compatible ways. For example, adding RPCs, or fields to messages
should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.

## Quickstart
