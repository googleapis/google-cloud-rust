# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**FEEDBACK WANTED:** We believe the APIs in this crate are stable, and
do not anticipate any breaking changes are needed. We are looking for
feedback before labeling the APIs "1.0". Changes (even breaking changes)
are still possible, but not expected.

We also believe the implementation is ready for production, bugs are
still possible, but not expected.

Manages keys and performs cryptographic operations in a central cloud
service, for direct use by other cloud resources and applications.
