/// # Service Description
///
/// Executions is used to start and manage running instances of
/// [Workflows][google.cloud.workflows.v1.Workflow] called executions.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// `Executions` has various configuration parameters, the defaults should
/// work with most applications.
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `Executions` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `Executions` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
