# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Policy Simulator API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->


Policy Simulator is a collection of endpoints for creating, running, and
viewing a [Replay][google.cloud.policysimulator.v1.Replay]. A `Replay` is
a type of simulation that lets you see how your members' access to
resources might change if you changed your IAM policy.

During a `Replay`, Policy Simulator re-evaluates, or replays, past access
attempts under both the current policy and your proposed policy, and
compares those results to determine how your members' access might change
under the
proposed policy.

The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client
libraries are designed to preserve backwards compatibility when the service
changes in compatible ways. For example, adding RPCs, or fields to messages
should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.

## Quickstart

The main types to work with this crate are the clients:
