# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Policy Simulator API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**WARNING:** this crate is under active development. We expect multiple breaking
changes in the upcoming releases. Testing is also incomplete, we do **not**
recommend that you use this crate in production. We welcome feedback about the
APIs, documentation, missing features, bugs, etc.

Policy Simulator is a collection of endpoints for creating, running, and
viewing a [Replay][google.cloud.policysimulator.v1.Replay]. A `Replay` is
a type of simulation that lets you see how your members' access to
resources might change if you changed your IAM policy.

During a `Replay`, Policy Simulator re-evaluates, or replays, past access
attempts under both the current policy and your proposed policy, and
compares those results to determine how your members' access might change
under the
proposed policy.
