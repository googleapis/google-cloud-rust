//! Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Device Streaming API
//!
//! **FEEDBACK WANTED:** We believe the APIs in this crate are stable, and
//! do not anticipate any breaking changes are needed. We are looking for
//! feedback before labeling the APIs "1.0". Changes (even breaking changes)
//! are still possible, but not expected.
//!
//! We also believe the implementation is ready for production, bugs are
//! still possible, but not expected.
//!
//!
//! **WARNING:** some RPCs have no corresponding Rust function to call them.
//! Typically these are streaming RPCs. We expect adding these RPCs in a
//! way that does not break the existing APIs or changes their behavior in a
//! significant way. We do anticipate a number of new crate dependencies
//! will be required. If you need these RPCs please open an issue in our
//! GitHub repository.
//!
//!
//! This crate contains traits, types, and functions to interact with Device Streaming API
//! Most applications will use the structs defined in the [client] module.
//! More specifically:
//!
//! * [DirectAccessService](client/struct.DirectAccessService.html)
