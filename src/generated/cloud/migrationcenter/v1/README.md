# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Migration Center API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

A unified platform that helps you accelerate your end-to-end cloud journey
from your current on-premises or cloud environments to Google Cloud.

The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client
libraries are designed to preserve backwards compatibility when the service
changes in compatible ways. For example, adding RPCs, or fields to messages
should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.

## Quickstart
