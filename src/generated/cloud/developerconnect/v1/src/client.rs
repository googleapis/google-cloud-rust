/// Implements a client for the Developer Connect API.

/// # Example
/// ```

/// # Service Description
///
/// Service describing handlers for resources
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// To configure `DeveloperConnect` use the `with_*` methods in the type returned
/// by [builder()][DeveloperConnect::builder]. The default configuration should
/// work for most applications. Common configuration changes include
///
/// * [with_endpoint()]: by default this client uses the global default endpoint
///   (`https://developerconnect.googleapis.com`). Applications using regional
///   endpoints or running in restricted networks (e.g. a network configured
//    with [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]) may want to
///   override this default.
/// * [with_credentials()]: by default this client uses
///   [Application Default Credentials]. Applications using custom
///   authentication may need to override this default.
///
/// [with_endpoint()]: super::builder::developer_connect::ClientBuilder::with_endpoint
/// [with_credentials()]: super::builder::developer_connect::ClientBuilder::credentials
