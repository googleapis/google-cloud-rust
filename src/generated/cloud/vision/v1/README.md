# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Cloud Vision API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**FEEDBACK WANTED:** We believe the APIs in this crate are stable, and
do not anticipate any breaking changes are needed. We are looking for
feedback before labeling the APIs "1.0". Changes (even breaking changes)
are still possible, but not expected.

We also believe the implementation is ready for production, bugs are
still possible, but not expected.

Integrates Google Vision features, including image labeling, face, logo,
and landmark detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and detection
of explicit content, into applications.
