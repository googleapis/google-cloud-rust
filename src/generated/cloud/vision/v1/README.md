# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Cloud Vision API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->


Integrates Google Vision features, including image labeling, face, logo,
and landmark detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and detection
of explicit content, into applications.

The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client
libraries are designed to preserve backwards compatibility when the service
changes in compatible ways. For example, adding RPCs, or fields to messages
should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.
