///

/// categories like performance optimization, cost savings, reliability, feature
/// discovery, etc. Insights and recommendations are generated automatically
/// based on analysis of user resources, configuration and monitoring metrics.
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// `Recommender` has various configuration parameters, the defaults should
/// work with most applications.
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `Recommender` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `Recommender` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
