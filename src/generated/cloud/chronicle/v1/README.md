# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Chronicle API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->


The Google Cloud Security Operations API, popularly known as the Chronicle
API, serves endpoints that enable security analysts to analyze and
mitigate a security threat throughout its lifecycle

The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client
libraries are designed to preserve backwards compatibility when the service
changes in compatible ways. For example, adding RPCs, or fields to messages
should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.

## Quickstart
