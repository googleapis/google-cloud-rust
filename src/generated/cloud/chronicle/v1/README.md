# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Chronicle API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**FEEDBACK WANTED:** We believe the APIs in this crate are stable, and
do not anticipate any breaking changes are needed. We are looking for
feedback before labeling the APIs "1.0". Changes (even breaking changes)
are still possible, but not expected.

We also believe the implementation is ready for production, bugs are
still possible, but not expected.

The Google Cloud Security Operations API, popularly known as the Chronicle
API, serves endpoints that enable security analysts to analyze and
mitigate a security threat throughout its lifecycle
