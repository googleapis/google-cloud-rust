/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `VideoIntelligenceService` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `VideoIntelligenceService` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`

    /// the [lro::Poller] trait. You need to call `Poller::poll` on this
    /// `Poller` at least once to start the LRO. You may periodically poll this
    /// object to find the status of the operation. The poller automatically
    /// extract the final response value and any intermediate metadata values.
    ///
    /// Calling [send()] on the resulting builder starts a LRO (long-Running
    /// Operation). LROs run in the background, and the application may poll
    /// them periodically to find out if they have succeeded, or failed. See
    /// below for instructions on how to manually use the resulting [Operation].
    /// We recommend `poller()` in favor of `send()`.
    ///
    /// ## Polling until completion
    ///
    /// Applications that do not care about intermediate results in a
    /// long-running operation may use the [until_done()] function:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// # use gax::Result;
    /// # use google_cloud_videointelligence_v1::model;
    /// async fn wait(
    ///     mut poller: impl lro::Poller<model::AnnotateVideoResponse, model::AnnotateVideoProgress>

    ///     poller.until_done().await
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// This will wait until the LRO completes (successfully or with an error).
    /// Applications can set the [PollingPolicy] and [PollingBackoffPolicy] to
    /// control for how long the function runs.
    ///
    /// ## Polling with detailed metadata updates
    ///
    /// Using the result of [poller()] follows a common pattern:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// # use gax::Result;
    /// # use google_cloud_videointelligence_v1::model;
    /// async fn wait(
    ///     mut poller: impl lro::Poller<model::AnnotateVideoResponse, model::AnnotateVideoProgress>
    /// ) -> Result<model::AnnotateVideoResponse> {
    ///     while let Some(p) = poller.poll().await {
    ///         match p {
    ///             lro::PollingResult::Completed(r) => { return r; },
    ///             lro::PollingResult::InProgress(m) => { println!("in progress {m:?}"); },
    ///             lro::PollingResult::PollingError(_) => { /* ignored */ },
    ///         }
    ///         tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(1)).await;
    ///     }
    ///     Err(gax::error::Error::other("LRO never completed"))
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Manually polling long-running operations
    ///
    /// If you call [send()], you need to examine the contents of the resulting
    /// [Operation][longrunning::model::Operation] to determine the result of
    /// the operation.
    ///
    /// If the `done` field is `true`, the operation has completed. The `result`
    /// field contains the final response, this will be a [crate::model::AnnotateVideoResponse] (as
    /// an [Any]), or the error (as a `Status`).
    ///
    /// If the `done` field is `false`, the operation has not completed.  The
    /// operation may also include a [crate::model::AnnotateVideoProgress] value in the `metadata`
    /// field. This value would also be encoded as an [Any]. The metadata may
    /// include information about how much progress the LRO has made.
    ///
    /// To find out if the operation has completed, use the [get_operation]
    /// method and repeat the steps outlined above.
