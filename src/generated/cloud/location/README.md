# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Cloud Metadata API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->


This API provides static metadata about Google Cloud Platform. Currently,
it only provides basic information about Google Cloud locations, such as
zones, regions, and countries.

The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client
libraries are designed to preserve backwards compatibility when the service
changes in compatible ways. For example, adding RPCs, or fields to messages
should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.

## Quickstart
