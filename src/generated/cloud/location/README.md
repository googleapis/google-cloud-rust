# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Cloud Metadata API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**FEEDBACK WANTED:** We believe the APIs in this crate are stable, and
do not anticipate any breaking changes are needed. We are looking for
feedback before labeling the APIs "1.0". Changes (even breaking changes)
are still possible, but not expected.

We also believe the implementation is ready for production, bugs are
still possible, but not expected.

This API provides static metadata about Google Cloud Platform. Currently,
it only provides basic information about Google Cloud locations, such as
zones, regions, and countries.

## Quickstart

The main types to work with this crate are the clients:

- [Locations]
