# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Cloud TPU API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->


TPU API provides customers with access to Google TPU technology.

The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client

should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.
