# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Parameter Manager API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->

**FEEDBACK WANTED:** We believe the APIs in this crate are stable, and
do not anticipate any breaking changes are needed. We are looking for
feedback before labeling the APIs "1.0". Changes (even breaking changes)
are still possible, but not expected.

We also believe the implementation is ready for production, bugs are
still possible, but not expected.

Parameter Manager is a single source of truth to store, access and manage
the lifecycle of your workload parameters. Parameter Manager aims to make
management of sensitive application parameters effortless for customers
without diminishing focus on security.
