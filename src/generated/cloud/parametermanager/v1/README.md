# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Parameter Manager API

<!-- Code generated by sidekick. DO NOT EDIT. -->


Parameter Manager is a single source of truth to store, access and manage
the lifecycle of your workload parameters. Parameter Manager aims to make
management of sensitive application parameters effortless for customers
without diminishing focus on security.

The client library types and functions are stable and not expected to change.
Please note that Google Cloud services do change from time to time. The client
libraries are designed to preserve backwards compatibility when the service
changes in compatible ways. For example, adding RPCs, or fields to messages
should not introduce breaking changes to the client libraries.

## Quickstart
