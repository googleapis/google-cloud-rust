/// Implements a client for the Access Approval API.
///
/// # Service Description
///
/// This API allows a customer to manage accesses to cloud resources by
/// Google personnel. It defines the following resource model:
///
/// - The API has a collection of
///   [ApprovalRequest][google.cloud.accessapproval.v1.ApprovalRequest]
///   resources, named `approvalRequests/{approval_request}`
/// - The API has top-level settings per Project/Folder/Organization, named
///   `accessApprovalSettings`
///
/// The service also periodically emails a list of recipients, defined at the
/// Project/Folder/Organization level in the accessApprovalSettings, when there
/// is a pending ApprovalRequest for them to act on. The ApprovalRequests can
/// also optionally be published to a Pub/Sub topic owned by the customer
/// (contact support if you would like to enable Pub/Sub notifications).
///
/// ApprovalRequests can be approved or dismissed. Google personnel can only
/// access the indicated resource or resources if the request is approved
/// (subject to some exclusions:
/// <https://cloud.google.com/access-approval/docs/overview#exclusions>).
///
/// Note: Using Access Approval functionality will mean that Google may not be
/// able to meet the SLAs for your chosen products, as any support response times
/// may be dramatically increased. As such the SLAs do not apply to any service
/// disruption to the extent impacted by Customer's use of Access Approval. Do
/// not enable Access Approval for projects where you may require high service
/// availability and rapid response by Google Cloud Support.
///
/// After a request is approved or dismissed, no further action may be taken on
/// it. Requests with the requested_expiration in the past or with no activity
/// for 14 days are considered dismissed. When an approval expires, the request
/// is considered dismissed.
///
/// If a request is not approved or dismissed, we call it pending.
///
/// [google.cloud.accessapproval.v1.ApprovalRequest]: crate::model::ApprovalRequest
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// `AccessApproval` has various configuration parameters, the defaults should
/// work with most applications.
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `AccessApproval` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `AccessApproval` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
