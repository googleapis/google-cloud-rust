/// # Service Description
///
/// Configures and manages Cloud Memorystore for Redis instances
///
/// Google Cloud Memorystore for Redis v1
///
/// The `redis.googleapis.com` service implements the Google Cloud Memorystore
/// for Redis API and defines the following resource model for managing Redis
/// instances:
///
/// * The service works with a collection of cloud projects, named: `/projects/*`
/// * Each project has a collection of available locations, named: `/locations/*`
/// * Each location has a collection of Redis instances, named: `/instances/*`
/// * As such, Redis instances are resources of the form:
///   `/projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}`
///
/// Note that location_id must be referring to a GCP `region`; for example:
///
/// * `projects/redpepper-1290/locations/us-central1/instances/my-redis`
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// To configure `CloudRedis` use the `with_*` methods in the type returned
/// by [builder()][CloudRedis::builder]. The default configuration should
/// work for most applications. Common configuration changes include
///
/// * [with_endpoint()]: by default this client uses the global default endpoint
///   (`https://redis.googleapis.com`). Applications using regional
///   endpoints or running in restricted networks (e.g. a network configured
//    with [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]) may want to
///   override this default.
/// * [with_credentials()]: by default this client uses
///   [Application Default Credentials]. Applications using custom
///   authentication may need to override this default.
///
/// [with_endpoint()]: super::builder::cloud_redis::ClientBuilder::with_endpoint
/// [with_credentials()]: super::builder::cloud_redis::ClientBuilder::credentials
/// [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls]: https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/private-connectivity
/// [Application Default Credentials]: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#adc
///
/// # Pooling and Cloning
///
/// `CloudRedis` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `CloudRedis` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
