/// An implementation of [crate::traits::InstanceAdmin] to make requests with.
///
/// `InstanceAdmin` has various configuration parameters, but the defaults
/// are set to work with most applications.
///
/// `InstanceAdmin` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `InstanceAdmin` in
/// an [Rc](std::rc::Rc) or [Arc] to reuse it, because it already uses an `Arc`
/// internally.
///
/// Cloud Spanner Instance Admin API
///
/// The Cloud Spanner Instance Admin API can be used to create, delete,
/// modify and list instances. Instances are dedicated Cloud Spanner serving
/// and storage resources to be used by Cloud Spanner databases.
///
/// Each instance has a "configuration", which dictates where the
/// serving resources for the Cloud Spanner instance are located (e.g.,
/// US-central, Europe). Configurations are created by Google based on
/// resource availability.
///
/// Cloud Spanner billing is based on the instances that exist and their
/// sizes. After an instance exists, there are no additional
/// per-database or per-operation charges for use of the instance
/// (though there may be additional network bandwidth charges).
/// Instances offer isolation: problems with databases in one instance
/// will not affect other instances. However, within an instance
/// databases can affect each other. For example, if one database in an
/// instance receives a lot of requests and consumes most of the
/// instance resources, fewer resources are available for other
/// databases in that instance, and their performance may suffer.
