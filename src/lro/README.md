# Google Cloud Client Libraries for Rust - Long-running Operation Support

The Client Libraries for Rust are under active development. We are creating
placeholder crates so we can reference them in our code and tooling.

**WARNING:** this crate is under active development. We expect multiple breaking
changes in the upcoming releases. Testing is also incomplete, we do **not**
recommend that you use this crate in production. We welcome feedback about the
APIs, documentation, missing features, bugs, etc.
