/// An implementation of [crate::traits::Iampolicy] to make requests with.
///
/// `Iampolicy` has various configuration parameters, but the defaults
/// are set to work with most applications.
///
/// `Iampolicy` holds a connection pool internally, it is advised to
/// create one and the reuse it.  You do not need to wrap `Iampolicy` in
/// an [Rc](std::sync::Rc) or [Arc](std::async::Arc) to reuse it, because it
/// already uses an `Arc` internally.
///
/// API Overview
///
/// Manages Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.
///
/// Any implementation of an API that offers access control features
/// implements the google.iam.v1.IAMPolicy interface.
///
/// ## Data model
///
/// Access control is applied when a principal (user or service account), takes
/// some action on a resource exposed by a service. Resources, identified by
/// URI-like names, are the unit of access control specification. Service
/// implementations can choose the granularity of access control and the
/// supported permissions for their resources.
/// For example one database service may allow access control to be
/// specified only at the Table level, whereas another might allow access control
/// to also be specified at the Column level.
///
/// ## Policy Structure
///
/// See google.iam.v1.Policy
///
/// This is intentionally not a CRUD style API because access control policies
/// are created and deleted implicitly with the resources to which they are
/// attached.
