/// A Duration represents a signed, fixed-length span of time represented
/// as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond
/// resolution. It is independent of any calendar and concepts like "day"
/// or "month". It is related to Timestamp in that the difference between
/// two Timestamp values is a Duration and it can be added or subtracted
/// from a Timestamp. Range is approximately +-10,000 years.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Example 1: Compute Duration from two Timestamps in pseudo code.
///
///     Timestamp start = ...;
///     Timestamp end = ...;
///     Duration duration = ...;
///
///     duration.seconds = end.seconds - start.seconds;
///     duration.nanos = end.nanos - start.nanos;
///
///     if (duration.seconds < 0 && duration.nanos > 0) {
///       duration.seconds += 1;
///       duration.nanos -= 1000000000;
///     } else if (duration.seconds > 0 && duration.nanos < 0) {
///       duration.seconds -= 1;
///       duration.nanos += 1000000000;
///     }
///
/// Example 2: Compute Timestamp from Timestamp + Duration in pseudo code.
///
///     Timestamp start = ...;
///     Duration duration = ...;
///     Timestamp end = ...;
///
///     end.seconds = start.seconds + duration.seconds;
///     end.nanos = start.nanos + duration.nanos;
///
///     if (end.nanos < 0) {
///       end.seconds -= 1;
///       end.nanos += 1000000000;
///     } else if (end.nanos >= 1000000000) {
///       end.seconds += 1;
///       end.nanos -= 1000000000;
///     }
///
/// Example 3: Compute Duration from datetime.timedelta in Python.
///
///     td = datetime.timedelta(days=3, minutes=10)
///     duration = Duration()
///     duration.FromTimedelta(td)
///

///
/// In JSON format, the Duration type is encoded as a string rather than an
/// object, where the string ends in the suffix "s" (indicating seconds) and
/// is preceded by the number of seconds, with nanoseconds expressed as
/// fractional seconds. For example, 3 seconds with 0 nanoseconds should be
/// encoded in JSON format as "3s", while 3 seconds and 1 nanosecond should
/// be expressed in JSON format as "3.000000001s", and 3 seconds and 1

/// `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:

///
/// Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b`
/// fields in the message found in `f`, and `d` a field found in the
/// message in `f.b`.
///
/// Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be
/// returned by a get operation or modified by an update operation.
/// Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).
///
/// # Field Masks in Projections
///
/// When used in the context of a projection, a response message or
/// sub-message is filtered by the API to only contain those fields as
/// specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
/// example is applied to a response message as follows:
///
///     f {
///       a : 22
///       b {
///         d : 1
///         x : 2
///       }
///       y : 13
///     }
///     z: 8
///
/// The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z
/// (their value will be set to the default, and omitted in proto text
/// output):
///
///
///     f {
///       a : 22
///       b {
///         d : 1
///       }
///     }
///
/// A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a
/// paths string.
///
/// If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the
/// operation applies to all fields (as if a FieldMask of all fields
/// had been specified).
///
/// Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the
/// top-level response message. In case of a REST get operation, the
/// field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST
/// list operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message
/// in the returned resource list. In case of a REST custom method,
/// other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
/// clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
/// any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
/// behavior for APIs.
///
/// # Field Masks in Update Operations
///
/// A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
/// targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
/// to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
/// and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
/// describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
/// fields not covered by the mask.
///
/// If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
/// be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
/// a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.
///
/// If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
/// update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
/// in the target resource.
///
/// For example, given the target message:
///
///     f {
///       b {
///         d: 1
///         x: 2
///       }
///       c: [1]
///     }
///
/// And an update message:
///
///     f {
///       b {
///         d: 10
///       }
///       c: [2]
///     }
///
/// then if the field mask is:
///
///  paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]
///
/// then the result will be:
///
///     f {
///       b {
///         d: 10
///         x: 2
///       }
///       c: [1, 2]
///     }
///
/// An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
/// repeated and message fields.
///
/// In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
/// be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
/// Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
/// instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
/// not provide a mask as described below.
///
/// If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
/// all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
/// Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
/// fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
/// the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
/// behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
/// a field mask, producing an error if not.
///
/// As with get operations, the location of the resource which
/// describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
/// operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
/// required to be honored by the API.
///
/// ## Considerations for HTTP REST
///
/// The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
/// be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
/// (PUT must only be used for full updates).
///
/// # JSON Encoding of Field Masks
///
/// In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
/// separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
/// to/from lower-camel naming conventions.
///
/// As an example, consider the following message declarations:
///
///     message Profile {
///       User user = 1;
///       Photo photo = 2;
///     }
///     message User {
///       string display_name = 1;
///       string address = 2;
///     }
///
/// In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:
///
///     mask {
///       paths: "user.display_name"
///       paths: "photo"
///     }
///
/// In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:
///
///     {
///       mask: "user.displayName,photo"
///     }
///
/// # Field Masks and Oneof Fields
///
/// Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
/// following message:
///
///     message SampleMessage {
///       oneof test_oneof {
///         string name = 4;
///         SubMessage sub_message = 9;
///       }
///     }
///
/// The field mask can be:
///
///     mask {
///       paths: "name"
///     }
///
/// Or:
///
///     mask {
///       paths: "sub_message"
///     }
///
/// Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
/// paths.
///
/// ## Field Mask Verification
///
/// The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
/// request should verify the included field paths, and return an
/// `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

///
/// Example 6: Compute Timestamp from current time in Python.
///
///     timestamp = Timestamp()
///     timestamp.GetCurrentTime()
///
/// # JSON Mapping
///
/// In JSON format, the Timestamp type is encoded as a string in the
/// [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format. That is, the
/// format is "{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{min}:{sec}[.{frac_sec}]Z"
/// where {year} is always expressed using four digits while {month}, {day},
/// {hour}, {min}, and {sec} are zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional
/// seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution),
/// are optional. The "Z" suffix indicates the timezone ("UTC"); the timezone
/// is required. A proto3 JSON serializer should always use UTC (as indicated by
/// "Z") when printing the Timestamp type and a proto3 JSON parser should be
/// able to accept both UTC and other timezones (as indicated by an offset).
///
/// For example, "2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z" encodes 15.01 seconds past
/// 01:30 UTC on January 15, 2017.
///
