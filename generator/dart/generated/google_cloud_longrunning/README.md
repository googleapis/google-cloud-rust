## What's this?

The Google Cloud client library for the Long Running Operations API.

Defines types and an abstract service to handle long-running operations.

[Long-running operations] are a common pattern to handle methods that may take
a significant amount of time to execute. Many Google APIs return an `Operation`
message (defined in this package) that are roughly analogous to a Future. The
operation will eventually complete, though it may still return an error on
completion. The client libraries provide helpers to simplify polling of these
operations.
